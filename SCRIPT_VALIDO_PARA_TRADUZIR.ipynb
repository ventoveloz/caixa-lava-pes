            "[01:43.000 --> 01:46.500]  Ele tinha falado disso, mas eu nunca vi o processo.\n",
            "[01:46.500 --> 01:48.500]  Nunca tinha visto o processo.\n",
            "[01:49.000 --> 01:54.500]  E aí acabou que o advogado que me ajudou,\n",
            "[01:54.500 --> 01:56.500]  o último advogado que me ajudou,\n",
            "[01:56.500 --> 02:00.000]  foi procurar e achou a interdição.\n",
            "[02:00.000 --> 02:07.000]  Achou o processo do espólio, como eu falo, inventário.\n",
            "[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  Então ele achou tudo.\n",
            "[02:11.000 --> 02:14.000]  Me deu e eu fiquei meio preocupado.\n",
            "[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  E aí fui e falei, vou procurar um advogado.\n",
            "[02:17.000 --> 02:18.500]  E aí fui procurar o doutor Sandro.\n",
            "[02:18.500 --> 02:21.500]  Mas o meu irmão, a família, eu falei, olha só,\n",
            "[02:21.500 --> 02:25.500]  a minha condição para assinar o inventário do meu tio,\n",
            "[02:25.500 --> 02:28.000]  para deixar vocês receberem esse dinheiro,\n",
            "[02:28.000 --> 02:30.500]  sem ir para a justiça extrajudicial,\n",
            "[02:30.500 --> 02:32.500]  porque aí todo mundo pega o dinheiro rápido.\n",
            "[02:32.500 --> 02:34.000]  Porque o meu não vai vir rápido,\n",
            "[02:34.000 --> 02:36.500]  o meu inventário já está na justiça.\n",
            "[02:36.500 --> 02:38.500]  O meu irmão não quer que faça de outra forma,\n",
            "[02:38.500 --> 02:41.000]  porque a minha irmã aprontou muito.\n",
            "[02:41.000 --> 02:44.500]  Ele acha que eu também tenho algumas dificuldades.\n",
            "[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  Então ele quer que tudo passe pela justiça.\n",
            "[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  Então eu fui procurar o doutor Sandro,\n",
            "[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  mas o meu irmão, ele amançou as coisas.\n",
            "[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  Meu pedido para a família foi, por favor,\n",
            "[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  vocês peçam o meu irmão para tirar a interdição.\n",
            "[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  E ele tirou a interdição.\n",
            "[03:02.000 --> 03:09.000]  Ele foi lá no processo, pediu a desistência,\n",
            "[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  anexou essa desistência no inventário.\n",
            "[03:12.500 --> 03:17.500]  Então o que eu quero é que deixe ele fazer do jeito que ele quer,\n",
            "[03:17.500 --> 03:21.500]  porque brigar com o meu irmão não vai ser bom para mim.\n",
            "[03:21.500 --> 03:27.000]  E aí eu estava decidido a fazer isso, a entrar nessa briga,\n",
            "[03:27.000 --> 03:32.500]  mas eu acho que isso é perda para mim.\n",
            "[03:32.500 --> 03:34.500]  Eu vou perder se eu entrar nessa briga.\n",
            "[03:34.500 --> 03:37.500]  Eu vou perder porque o meu irmão é muito mais esperto do que eu.\n",
            "[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  Então eu preciso deixar ele conduzir isso.\n",
            "[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  Eu não botei advogado até agora no inventário.\n",
            "[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  Não vou colocar, eu não vou deixar.\n",
            "[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  Vou deixar ele conduzir isso.\n",
            "[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  E seja o que Deus quiser, dona Mônica.\n",
            "[03:52.000 --> 03:59.000]  Eu peguei algum dinheiro, não estou desprevenido.\n",
            "[03:59.500 --> 04:03.500]  Então eu estou assim, estou trabalhando,\n",
            "[04:03.500 --> 04:08.500]  estou procurando ter uma vida diferente da vida que eu tinha.\n",
            "[04:08.500 --> 04:10.500]  Você trabalha com o quê?\n",
            "[04:10.500 --> 04:12.500]  Eu sou Uber agora.\n",
            "[04:12.500 --> 04:13.500]  Tá bom.\n",
            "[04:13.500 --> 04:23.500]  Mas na verdade eu formei e tenho vontade de exercer a minha profissão.\n",
            "[04:23.500 --> 04:25.500]  E arquiteto.\n",
            "[04:25.500 --> 04:26.500]  Sou arquiteto.\n",
            "[04:26.500 --> 04:28.500]  É uma profissão linda.\n",
            "[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  Se eu não fosse advogado eu seria arquiteto.\n",
            "[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  É muito bonito mesmo a gente realizar o sonho das pessoas.\n",
            "[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  Verdade.\n",
            "[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  É satisfeito, né?\n",
            "[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  A pessoa satisfeita através do seu trabalho.\n",
            "[04:46.000 --> 04:52.000]  E não é só isso, porque eu tenho aspirações urbanas.\n",
            "[04:52.000 --> 04:58.000]  Então eu gosto de olhar a cidade porque meu pai era arquiteto.\n",
            "[04:58.500 --> 05:00.500]  E aí eu gosto de ver o funcionamento da cidade.\n",
            "[05:00.500 --> 05:05.500]  Então eu tenho aspirações de trabalhar com o ambiente urbano.\n",
            "[05:05.500 --> 05:12.500]  Mas eu ainda não consegui essa minha vontade e eu estou trabalhando de Uber.\n",
            "[05:12.500 --> 05:14.500]  E o meu irmão está vendo essa mudança.\n",
            "[05:14.500 --> 05:16.500]  Falou, não cara, tudo está se mudando.\n",
            "[05:16.500 --> 05:19.500]  Eu espero que você continue mudando.\n",
            "[05:19.500 --> 05:23.500]  E aí o que aconteceu foi que eu paguei o Dr. Sando para ele fazer.\n",
            "[05:23.500 --> 05:26.500]  E agora eu não quero mais fazer.\n",
            "[05:26.500 --> 05:27.500]  Entendeu?\n",
            "[05:27.500 --> 05:29.000]  Eu não quero mais fazer.\n",
            "[05:29.000 --> 05:36.000]  Aí eu gostaria de saber se o Dr. Sando pode me devolver o dinheiro que eu deixei aí, entendeu?\n",
            "[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  Vamos lá.\n",
            "[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  Entendi, entendi tudo.\n",
            "[05:38.000 --> 05:40.000]  Por isso que eu gostaria que você ouvia essa aqui.\n",
            "[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  Um café comigo, para eu poder passar tudo.\n",
            "[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  Você está de Uber.\n",
            "[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  Se eu passo aqui, deve passar aqui na frente dos escritórios.\n",
            "[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  Não, eu não é um destino...\n",
            "[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  Você roda por onde?\n",
            "[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  Eu rodo mais aqui na Zona Sul.\n",
            "[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  Mas não é um destino que eu vá a esse lado de Curitiba.\n",
            "[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  É Curitiba aí ou é Taquara?\n",
            "[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  Não, aqui é Taquara.\n",
            "[05:57.500 --> 05:58.500]  Taquara.\n",
            "[05:58.500 --> 06:00.500]  É muito distante.\n",
            "[06:00.500 --> 06:02.500]  Aí, assim, eu procuro...\n",
            "[06:02.500 --> 06:04.500]  Porque meu carro não tem gás.\n",
            "[06:04.500 --> 06:08.500]  Então eu procuro mais corridas pequenas.\n",
            "[06:08.500 --> 06:10.500]  Hoje é essa a minha situação, tá?\n",
            "[06:10.500 --> 06:13.500]  Não vou dizer que isso vai continuar.\n",
            "[06:13.500 --> 06:17.500]  Porque as corridas pequenas, elas precisam ter feito muitas corridas.\n",
            "[06:17.500 --> 06:22.500]  Para ter a tua meta diária batida.\n",
            "[06:22.500 --> 06:23.500]  Mas a minha intenção é...\n",
            "[06:23.500 --> 06:26.500]  Eu sei como é que a gente tem muito cliente de Uber.\n",
            "[06:26.500 --> 06:28.000]  Mas a gente sabe como funciona.\n",
            "[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  Então a minha intenção é ver se eu consigo um carro diferente.\n",
            "[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  Mas aí, para isso, eu preciso conversar com o meu irmão.\n",
            "[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  Conversar com a minha irmã.\n",
            "[06:38.000 --> 06:39.000]  Entendeu?\n",
            "[06:39.000 --> 06:46.000]  Eu não vou ultrapassar a hierarquia das coisas.\n",
            "[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  O meu irmão realmente, ele se fez sozinho.\n",
            "[06:50.500 --> 06:53.500]  Ele então progrediu.\n",
            "[06:53.500 --> 06:59.500]  E ele tem mais noção de como conduzir.\n",
            "[06:59.500 --> 07:04.500]  Como fazer uma coisa lucrativa.\n",
            "[07:04.500 --> 07:06.500]  Então, assim, é conversando com eles.\n",
            "[07:06.500 --> 07:09.500]  Olha, a minha intenção é trocar por um carro de gás.\n",
            "[07:09.500 --> 07:11.500]  Ou por um carro híbrido.\n",
            "[07:11.500 --> 07:12.500]  Qual é o seu carro?\n",
            "[07:12.500 --> 07:14.500]  Hoje é um Corolla.\n",
            "[07:14.500 --> 07:17.500]  Ah, o Corolla é um excelente carro.\n",
            "[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  Um carro que não quebra.\n",
            "[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  Não, eu adoro o meu carro.\n",
            "[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  Mas eu não botei o gás.\n",
            "[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  Aí ele bebe um pouquinho.\n",
            "[07:29.000 --> 07:31.000]  Bebe, bebe.\n",
            "[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  Vamos lá, seu Sidney.\n",
            "[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  Vamos falar então sobre o que o senhor está solicitando.\n",
            "[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  Eu, antes de ligar para o senhor,\n",
            "[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  viu que eu entrei aqui no atendimento.\n",
            "[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Inclusive, eu vi que o senhor já era cliente nosso.\n",
            "[07:44.000 --> 07:47.000]  O senhor veio aqui acho que 2020.\n",
            "[07:47.500 --> 07:49.500]  E falou com outro advogado.\n",
            "[07:49.500 --> 07:52.500]  Não, eu nunca fui.\n",
            "[07:52.500 --> 07:56.500]  Eu procurei Doutor Sandro dentro da câmara.\n",
            "[07:56.500 --> 07:58.500]  Não, mas quando o senhor veio aqui,\n",
            "[07:58.500 --> 08:00.500]  o senhor não veio procurar a área criminal.\n",
            "[08:00.500 --> 08:01.500]  O senhor veio procurar a área civil.\n",
            "[08:01.500 --> 08:03.500]  Está aqui todo o atendimento realizado.\n",
            "[08:03.500 --> 08:05.500]  O senhor conversou com o Doutor André.\n",
            "[08:05.500 --> 08:07.500]  Não.\n",
            "[08:07.500 --> 08:09.500]  Deve ter alguma...\n",
            "[08:12.500 --> 08:14.500]  Não, quer ver?\n",
            "[08:14.500 --> 08:16.500]  Vou abrir aqui essa pasta.\n",
            "[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  Está aqui?\n",
            "[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  É porque realmente tem muito tempo.\n",
            "[08:21.000 --> 08:23.000]  Tem muito tempo.\n",
            "[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  Mas eu não fui.\n",
            "[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  Eu nunca tive problema com a justiça.\n",
            "[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  Não, não foi problema com a justiça, não.\n",
            "[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  Foi orientações que o senhor solicitou.\n",
            "[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  Quer ver?\n",
            "[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  Estou tentando abrir aqui a pasta para o senhor.\n",
            "[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  Para eu poder passar para o senhor.\n",
            "[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  Mas enfim.\n",
            "[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  Quando meu pai era vivo,\n",
            "[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  meu pai sempre evitou justiça.\n",
            "[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  Sempre.\n",
            "[08:46.500 --> 08:50.500]  Não sei nem como que o meu irmão se formou advogado.\n",
            "[08:50.500 --> 08:52.500]  Assim...\n",
            "[08:52.500 --> 08:54.500]  Se formou advogado.\n",
            "[08:54.500 --> 08:56.500]  E foi...\n",
            "[08:56.500 --> 08:58.500]  Foi fazer a vida dele.\n",
            "[08:58.500 --> 09:00.500]  Graças a Deus.\n",
            "[09:00.500 --> 09:02.500]  Seu Sidney, o senhor esteve aqui\n",
            "[09:02.500 --> 09:04.500]  em 6 de dezembro de 2021.\n",
            "[09:04.500 --> 09:06.500]  Resumidamente,\n",
            "[09:06.500 --> 09:08.500]  sou o primeiro de três irmãos.\n",
            "[09:08.500 --> 09:10.500]  Eu sou arquiteto.\n",
            "[09:10.500 --> 09:12.500]  Tenho um publicitário\n",
            "[09:12.500 --> 09:14.500]  e um advogado.\n",
            "[09:14.500 --> 09:16.500]  De uns tempos para cá,\n",
            "[09:16.500 --> 09:18.500]  os dois juntaram para...\n",
            "[09:18.500 --> 09:20.500]  E tem me pedido para assinar um papel.\n",
            "[09:20.500 --> 09:22.500]  Me declarando dependente.\n",
            "[09:22.500 --> 09:24.500]  Isso me leva ao segundo problema.\n",
            "[09:24.500 --> 09:26.500]  Me formei arquiteto.\n",
            "[09:26.500 --> 09:28.500]  Viu? O senhor esteve aqui.\n",
            "[09:28.500 --> 09:30.500]  Dei consulta aqui.\n",
            "[09:30.500 --> 09:32.500]  Sim, mas aí eu acho que não foi...\n",
            "[09:32.500 --> 09:34.500]  Não foi orientação.\n",
            "[09:34.500 --> 09:36.500]  Mas eu acho que não cheguei no escritório, não.\n",
            "[09:36.500 --> 09:38.500]  Ah, tá.\n",
            "[09:38.500 --> 09:40.500]  Pode ter sido uma consulta virtual.\n",
            "[09:40.500 --> 09:42.500]  Mas houve.\n",
            "[09:42.500 --> 09:44.500]  O senhor me mandou remarcar e tal.\n",
            "[09:44.500 --> 09:46.500]  Ou seja, eu sou de área cliente.\n",

            "[08:08.020 --> 08:10.140]  Mas ainda o que que faça? Vai chamar ou não vou,\n",
            "[08:10.180 --> 08:12.440]  porque eu não sou obrigado a falar de processo que eu tô atuando\n",
            "[08:12.480 --> 08:15.480]  ou de processo que eu fui contratado ainda que eu não tenha atuado.\n",
            "[08:15.520 --> 08:17.140]  Entende? Então, assim, irmão,\n",
            "[08:17.180 --> 08:19.480]  a gente trabalha pautado na legalidade.\n",
            "[08:19.520 --> 08:23.100]  Eu quero que você entenda que ninguém tá agindo de má fé.\n",
            "[08:23.140 --> 08:27.640]  Estudar é um processo da trabalho e é muito trabalhoso.\n",
            "[08:28.780 --> 08:31.560]  Entende? E foi feito pra você,\n",
            "[08:31.600 --> 08:33.600]  foi feito o todo o desatendimento,\n",
            "[08:33.640 --> 08:36.440]  como a gente faz pra todo e qualquer outro cliente, irmão.\n",
            "[08:36.520 --> 08:40.760]  Foi conversado, foi explicado de forma pormenorizada\n",
            "[08:40.800 --> 08:44.720]  e ainda assim você aceitou, assinou a procuração,\n",
            "[08:44.760 --> 08:48.940]  houve o contrato tácito em que pese a você não ter assinado o contrato.\n",
            "[08:48.980 --> 08:51.800]  A transferência do PIX, o pagamento,\n",
            "[08:51.840 --> 08:55.260]  já é comprovação de que o contrato verbal existe.\n",
            "[08:55.300 --> 08:57.400]  Então, assim, agimos dentro da legalidade.\n",
            "[08:57.440 --> 09:00.140]  Não estamos fazendo uma vírgula fora do lugar.\n",
            "[09:00.180 --> 09:01.980]  Agora é você avaliar.\n",
            "[09:02.020 --> 09:05.520]  Se você aceita a contraproposta não 15,\n",
            "[09:05.560 --> 09:10.140]  nem eu aceitaria, porque foi muito estudo, irmão.\n",
            "[09:10.180 --> 09:14.020]  Entre audiências, entre atendimentos, entre outros processos,\n",
            "[09:14.060 --> 09:17.180]  parte do nosso trabalho foi feito.\n",
            "[09:17.220 --> 09:19.060]  O trabalho total que é atuar no processo\n",
            "[09:19.100 --> 09:20.760]  não foi feito porque você não quis mais,\n",
            "[09:20.800 --> 09:22.560]  mas parte do trabalho foi feito.\n",
            "[09:22.600 --> 09:26.880]  Se você tivesse pagos 40 mil reais à vista,\n",
            "[09:26.920 --> 09:29.180]  obviamente, não atuamos no processo,\n",
            "[09:29.220 --> 09:32.600]  nós iríamos devolver exatamente a metade do valor,\n",
            "[09:32.640 --> 09:35.260]  porque o estudo do processo foi feito, irmão.\n",
            "[09:35.260 --> 09:39.220]  Por isso que a gente pede sempre 50% de entrada.\n",
            "[09:39.260 --> 09:42.300]  Por quê? Porque não é a primeira vez que isso acontece.\n",
            "[09:42.340 --> 09:44.260]  Isso já aconteceu outras vezes.\n",
            "[09:44.300 --> 09:46.680]  Tem cliente que entende quando desiste,\n",
            "[09:46.720 --> 09:48.140]  tem cliente que não entende.\n",
            "[09:48.180 --> 09:51.920]  Entretanto, a gente sempre faz pautar na legalidade.\n",
            "[09:51.960 --> 09:54.260]  A gente está nessa caminhada há 15 anos, meu amigo.\n",
            "[09:54.300 --> 09:56.840]  A gente não é pego mais de surpresa com nada.\n",
            "[09:56.880 --> 09:59.340]  Por isso que a gente coloca tudo no contrato,\n",
            "[09:59.380 --> 10:01.380]  por isso que o escritório é todo monitorado,\n",
            "[10:01.420 --> 10:04.960]  para que não haja contra-argumentação de que a gente enganou,\n",
            "[10:04.960 --> 10:06.260]  de que a gente mentiu, ao contrário.\n",
            "[10:06.300 --> 10:08.960]  A gente procura sempre ser transparente.\n",
            "[10:09.000 --> 10:12.120]  Aí você analisa, conversa com o seu irmão,\n",
            "[10:12.160 --> 10:13.880]  que é o advogado, entendeu?\n",
            "[10:13.920 --> 10:16.580]  Se ele for com você, o escritório não tem problema,\n",
            "[10:16.620 --> 10:18.460]  em que peça não ter feito nem um contrato,\n",
            "[10:18.500 --> 10:20.120]  nem com ele, nem com a sua irmã.\n",
            "[10:20.160 --> 10:22.840]  A doutora Mônica falou comigo que ia com a tua irmã lá.\n",
            "[10:22.880 --> 10:25.080]  Você se encerra contigo, é porque é a Mônica.\n",
            "[10:25.120 --> 10:26.920]  Se sou eu atendendo, não atendo nem com a tua irmã,\n",
            "[10:26.960 --> 10:28.540]  porque eu não negociei nada com ela.\n",
            "[10:28.580 --> 10:32.920]  Vou atender você todas as vezes que você for no escritório,\n",
            "[10:32.960 --> 10:35.420]  para te dar a explicação, porque foi você que me contratou.\n",
            "[10:35.460 --> 10:37.620]  Mas se a tua irmã vai, eu nem atendo a tua irmã,\n",
            "[10:37.660 --> 10:39.840]  porque eu não tratei nada com a tua irmã.\n",
            "[10:39.880 --> 10:41.220]  A tua irmã não pode te representar,\n",
            "[10:41.260 --> 10:44.580]  tu não é enteditada, ela não é advogada, entendeu?\n",
            "[10:44.620 --> 10:46.300]  Entendi.\n",
            "[10:46.340 --> 10:48.620]  Mas você analisa, meu irmão.\n",
            "[10:48.660 --> 10:51.760]  Estou te falando assim, com pureza de coração, como uma Karim,\n",
            "[10:51.800 --> 10:53.680]  não fizemos nada de errado.\n",
            "[10:53.720 --> 10:57.300]  E, ah, Sandro, o trabalho não foi feito. Me perdoa, Sidney.\n",
            "[10:57.340 --> 11:01.380]  Me perdoa com todo o respeito. O trabalho foi feito sim, meu irmão.\n",
            "[11:01.460 --> 11:03.460]  Trabalho foi feito.\n",
            "[11:03.500 --> 11:05.760]  O advogado estudou o processo.\n",

          "evalue": "Okay, fired.\nI don't know what you're talking about, but I don't know what you're talking about.\nI don't know what you're talking about.\nI brought it to you. There are two keys here.\nI have one, I have two, depending on the key.\nThere are two keys there.\nAline, I heard you talking to the robbers.\nI saw you complaining that the situation is difficult.\nAnd then you again come back with this story.\nAh, because Sidney used drugs. I don't know what. My life was bad.\nThat's it.\nBecause Sidney used drugs.\nI know, Aline, I understand that. But this has already happened, Aline.\nThis has already happened, it's gone back.\nI have no way to fix what happened.\nBut you have to serve as an example for João Pedro to take the road in his life.\nYes, I think you can use this to talk to João Pedro, talk to him.\nTalk to him to avoid drugs, because walking with poor people is not a problem.\nHe learned to be human with any kind of person.\nBut poor people use marijuana, use cocaine.\nIt has nothing to do with it.\nBut it was the cycle of friends that I had.\nIt was what you chose.\nIt was not the cycle that I chose, Aline.\nIt was what gave me, it was what happened.\nI was attacked on the street, the gringo attacked me,\nRicardo Pachão attacked me, along with I don't know who, they were always discriminating me.\nI was fat.\nAnd then I went to the favela.\nAnd there in the favela I learned all kinds of bullshit.\nBecause those boys are also lost.\nI learned all kinds of bullshit.\nI regret that you have had to live with this.\nBut this has already passed.\nLook, Aline, I wanted you to come here and talk to you about something.\nMy lawyer said that this thing of Marisa Penha is very serious.\nIt's very serious.\nAnd he asked me, he said,\nWould your sister be willing to help you?\nGood, I'm willing to help you.\nBut on the 5th I'm going to put the things.\nBecause I can't see you moving around and doing anything.\nCome here, bitch.\nThe apartment was a mess.\nLook, I'm sick here, my love.\nI'm here with COVID, with renal infection.\nI'm on medication.\nYou can see my exams here.\nDude, I cleaned the whole apartment.\nI take the best medicine.\nThen I cleaned the apartment.\nI'm cleaning it little by little.\nI'm 38 now, of fever.\nThen I lay down.\nNow.\nI know, Lima.\nI went to the bitch.\nWhat the fuck is this?\nWhat story is this that I came here with the bitch?\nI don't know, Janelle.\nEverything was dirty.\nThere was a woman's hair in the bathroom.\nYou know?\nThere was blood in the toilet.\nYou know?\nThere was toilet paper.\nNow you do...\nSit toilet paper.\nAnd clean the toilet.\nYeah, toilet paper, yeah.\nYou know?\nI'm not stupid.\nNo, I know.\nLook.\nSo.\nBut that doesn't mean I came here with the bitch.\nShe's not a bitch.\nShe's my friend.\nOkay, Cidina.\nLet me tell you something.\nI told João Pedro.\nI'm going to repeat it to you.\nI think your card didn't fall.\nSo.\nDo you want to travel?\nI contacted the operator.\nI've already read it to her.\nCheap massage now.\nYou don't understand.\nYou're not doing the math.\nYou're thinking about the money.\nYou don't even know how to live the rest of your life.\nNo.\nThe card is falling.\nYou know?\nI'm going to put it on paper.\nAnd I'm going to send it to João Pedro.\nYou know?\nThe things that I'm going to ask the judge.\nYou know?\nThat at the time I'm going to ask the judge.\nNow you are very vulgar.\nBecause you could.\nI know.\nYou could always try to get a salary for the rest of your life.\nNow you are so vulgar.\nThat you keep thinking that people are always wanting to fuck you.\nRicardo wanting to help you.\nYou know?\nI wanted to help you.\nIf I could, I would receive it.\nAfter you didn't want to.\nI went to talk to the lawyer.\nI said.\nSo.\nCan you receive it from João Pedro?\nAs a grandson.\nSince the father is absent.\nOnly if you declare yourself incapable.\nIf I declare myself incapable.\nI don't work in the state.\nI don't have a company.\nYou know?\nThen I can't work.\nBecause of.\nI don't know.\nSix thousand reais.\nIt's not worth it.\nNow you could have that.\nAnd have your car.\nMake your Uber.\nLive your life.\nFuck.\nSo many people.\nSet up a scheme.\nTo be able to.\nAn interdiction.\nFake.\nYou know?\nA.\nI know.\nI know.\nBecause no one can take anything.\nI know.\nThe process of inventing is a very serious thing.\nNo one can come and take what is yours.\nI know.\nNo one can take what is yours.\nBut it happens.\nThat I prefer it to be done.\nThe right way.\nYou don't have the ability to manage your life.\nI'm managing my life.\nI'm managing my life.\nI go out every day to work.\nI spent the whole night working.\nMy earnings in Uber.\nLast week it was two thousand.\nLast week it was one thousand and five hundred.\nSo introduce me.\nNo, no.\nStart putting things together.\nI'll send you a list of things.\nBecause the car is all broken.\nBut the car is all broken.\nThat doesn't mean anything, Aline.\nThe Uber experience is not just the car.\nThe Uber experience is the driver.\nIt's how I drive.\nDo you think you're going to work on it?\nOf course not, Aline.\nOf course not.\nOf course not.\nAnd what are your plans?\nOf course not.\nMy plans, Aline.\nIs that I can work as an architect.\nAs an architect planner.\nI would like to do what my dad did.\nArchitecture planning.\nBut I have some things going on.\nBecause Claudia has an idea.\nAnd I have another idea.\nAnd then we share ideas.\nMe and Claudia.\nGot it?\nAnd she has a goal of not...\nGot it?\nThis was last week.\nIt was February 12th, February 19th.\nWhich was the time of the carnival.\nWhich was all dynamic.\nBut that's it.\nHere, the income is weekly.\nThis here, 1500.\nIt's not bad.\nBut the car, 1145.\nIt's not bad.\nBut the car.\nBut the car drinks a lot.\nSo what's left is little.\nYou could have had a lot.\nWhen you bought this car.\nYou should have put the gas first.\nI know.\nNobody liked uv.\nGot it?\nGasoline.\nI know, Aline.\nBut it's rich.\nI know.\nI'm not rich.\nBut the gas makes some transformations in the car.\nIt makes holes in the engine block.\nAnd this car, when I bought it.\nIt had some electrical problems.\nAnd I'm still afraid.\nAnd it's not the time yet.\nYou have to take it to a car service.\nOr sell this car and get another one.\nThat's what I can think about.\nBut I'm part of a group of uber drivers.\nAnd the boys, even driving all day.\nDriving all night.\nTheir average is 400, 300 per day.\nThe ideal is to use my education.\nTo get clients who pay me to travel.\nThe other day the girl offered me.\nDo you want to take me to Terezópolis?\nThat's the kind of person I need.\nI have an evaluation in the uber.\nAn evaluation that is a little strange for me to understand.\nBecause it seems that people feel sorry for me.\nThey give me money, but they don't give me praise.\nOf course.\nBecause you don't drive very well.\nNo, no, no.\nI know, Aline.\nBut if I said I drove badly.\nI had already been expelled from the passport.\nNo, no, no.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nPeople feel sorry for you.\nBecause, come on.\nFirst you do uber black.\nYou don't dress according to uber black.\nMaybe, Aline.\nAnd the behavior within the uber.\nMaybe.\nIt's not uber black.\nSo it's good you have...\nMaybe, maybe.\nMaybe you're right.\nBut I prefer that my personality prevails.\nAnd my evaluation in general is good.\nBecause people thank me every time they get out of the car.\nThank you for the conversation.\nThank you for the sincerity.\nThank you.\nIt's how I am.\nI say what I think.\nYou're the kind of person who has a huge heart.\nSo I have a huge heart.\nBut you have to know that the huge heart doesn't solve.\nI know.\nMan, you have to treat yourself.\nAnd you don't know how to treat yourself.\nYou think you don't have a problem.\nAnd I have a problem.\nI do.\nBut Aline, I'm doing treatment.\nI don't know where you get it from that I don't do treatment.\nI'm going to the psychologist every week.\nEvery week to the psychologist.\nBut look, Aline.\nYou ran from the people at the clinic.\nI ran because the family clinic is not the IPUB.\nThe family clinic is not the IPUB.\nAnd the IPUB is not what it used to be.\nI'm going back to Maria da Penha.\nAnd I'm going to do a B.O.\nThat opened the apartment.\nAnd they took my papers from here.\nIncluding my folder.\nWith all the history.\nEverything I'm doing is for your good.\nI'm not going to put you in jail.\nAline, go ahead.\nLook, I understand one thing.\nYou're going to jail.\nI'm going to jail.\nGo ahead.\nDo you know why?\nBecause you don't have the measure.\nYou don't have the measure of what Maria da Penha's law is.\nI do.\nI do.\nYou have to...\nI do.\nI would like...\nI have the measure of what Maria da Penha's law is.\nAnd I'm a friend of the woman's secretary.\nSo?\nNo.\nLook.\nNo one is here to fuck anyone.\nI know, but...\nThe rules exist to be respected.\nI know.\nDo you think I talk to anyone?\nThat I mess with people?\nI didn't talk to anyone.\nNot even to the secretary.\nNot even to the governor.\nDo you understand?\nNot even to the bitch who gave birth.\nI know.\nAnd I'm holding everything.\nNow, Kako.\nI know.\nI'm not going back to being in jail.\nMaria da Penha's sentence...\nIt may not generate an entire prison.\nBut it can generate a prison...\nA prison in half.\nI can...\nHave a semi-open.\nOr be forced to go to sleep.\nTake my freedom.\nNo.\nBe forced to go to sleep.\nNo, Aline.\nDon't mess with Maria da Penha's law.\nLook.\nYou...\nYou're a thinker.\nYou spend your whole life being fucked up.\nYou fuck everyone's life.\nAline, I'm not fucked up.\nAline, I'm not fucked up.\nDo you think all your behavior is...\nAline, I'm not fucked up.\nI'm not fucked up.\nIt's hard to talk to someone like that.\nIt's hard because I'm not fucked up.\nAline, I graduated from a college.\nI'm a graduate.\nThank God.\nSo...\nI'm talking to you.\nI graduated from a college.\nI graduated from a college.\nI'm a graduate.\nSo, at that time, there was no drugs.\nThere was no shit.\nThere was no drugs.\nI graduated after graduation.\nThere was no drugs.\nI did specialization at UF.\nThere was no drugs.\nI went with Rita.\nRita today is president of the water company of Maricá.\nRita liked me.\nShe saw my difficulty.\nSidney is a good-hearted person, but she has difficulty.\nSo, I'm going to help him.\nRita helped me with the projects.\nBut the coordinator of the program didn't want to stay with me.\nShe didn't want to stay with me.\nAnd Rita doesn't answer me anymore.\nBut I didn't have...\nI had the ability to do specialization after graduation.\nI didn't have drugs.\nThere is no consistency of drugs.\nAnd so much of it is true.\nWhat do I bring?\nWhat kind of drug do you bring in Santa Marta?\nI don't know.\nBut isn't it so much constant?\nSidney, let me tell you something.\nI know everyone.\nAll the places you go to.\nI go there too.\nBut I go there in a different way.\nI go to the project.\nI know.\nI go there with the basics.\nI go there with...\nYou know?\nLight for people.\nI know.\nWe have a choice.\nWe can go to the worst and bring light.\nI know.\nWe have a choice in life, man.\nDo you think you don't have a problem?\nYou can even bring the drug dealer from Santa Marta.\nAnd he said, look, the boy really came here and bought.\nHe bought, I don't know, 50 reais of marijuana and took it home.\nBecause it was the way I had, that I was having, to calm me down.\nIt was a calming that I had.\nWhat do you think about this calming without...\nAline, I know, but look, understand.\nIf I were independent...\nDid you self-medicate?\nAs if I had done that.\nIf I were independent, I wouldn't have been so long without it.\nI would be older.\nDo you think people are forced to live in your grandfather's house?\nAn extremely conservative person.\nDo you think your grandfather is forced to live in a house with a person who smokes marijuana?\nDo you think your nephew is forced to feel the smell of marijuana?\nBut it was your father's choice that I would stay at home smoking marijuana\nthan take it to the street to avoid problems.\nTo avoid a smoker, something, understand?\nThat was my father's choice.\nIt was his choice.\nUntil he was able to face you and say that he didn't give you money.\nThat...\nWhy were you diagnosed?\nYes.\nAnd my mother simply decided...\nYou tried to treat yourself.\nYou fought, because you weren't going to take the medicine.\nThe medicine would leave you this and that.\nAnd my mother fought with Pedro.\nShe fought with Aline.\nShe got into a lot of trouble.\nIt was my mother's choice to hide.\nBecause at the time it was a shame to say that...\nThere is a difficulty.\nYes, but...\nLook, what a difficulty so many people...\nI know, but Aline...\nSo many successful people...\nI know, Aline.\nThe owner of EJZ, Rogerinho...\nHe was an extremely bright guy.\nI had a difficulty.\nYou threw the cover...\nI know, I know, Aline.\nBut I want you to understand...\nNow you're filling my bag.\nNo, I'm filling your bag.\nI'm here because the lawyer spoke to me.\nHe said, Sidney...\nYou can count on your sister's collaboration...\nTo be able to kill this thing.\nAnd then...\nThe lawyer who went there to put...\nPut an action saying that I'm...\nThat I'm doing homophobia.\nThis lawyer went there.\nWho went to do the homophobia action...\nI went to the police station.\nI'm guided by him.\nNo, I didn't.\nI went alone.\nI went alone.\nTell him that I'm going to get his name.\nNo, no, it wasn't.\nIt wasn't the lawyer.\nIt was the lawyer.\nIt was Caroline Rangel.\nAnd she didn't know.\nAnd the day she knew that I was going to the police station...\nShe said, Sidney, you're crazy.\nYou shouldn't have gone to the police station alone.\nI went alone to the police station.\nI was out of the house.\nI didn't know what to do.\nAnd I went to the police station.\nBut you didn't go to the police station, Sidney.\nI know.\nAnd you kept running away.\nAnd the guidance someone gave you...\nIt's all shit.\nI know.\nIf someone gave you guidance, you should have taken public defense.\nBecause you're thinking, do you think I'm in the state?\nBecause I know people.\nSidney, I only know people.\nPeople respect me.\nI understand.\nI work because I do social work.\nBecause I commit myself.\nYes.\nAnd, dear, I don't have any scheme.\nI don't have a vote purchase.\nI don't have any scheme.\nI know. Look.\nIt's just work.\nI have a commitment.\nYou didn't commit yourself to anything.\nYou kept speculating.\nBecause I know that everyone, Marcelo...\nEveryone wants to help you.\nThey also came to talk to me.\nThey said, Aline...\nEveryone wants to help you.\nBut you don't want to help yourself.\nSo I got to this point.\nDo you think you bring a flower to me?\nDo you think you bring a flower to me?\nDo you understand?\nAnd on the eve of the deal,\nwhen you're afraid of being arrested,\neverything will die.\nThen your lawyer came.\nHe told me.\nI don't know who he is on the day of the hearing.\nDo you understand?\nAnd I'll say...\nLook, you should have guided your client\nto do what was requested by him,\nwhat was requested by me,\nwhich is a very simple thing.\nNow, Sidney,\nall this will be resolved there.\nIf you want to receive your money,\ndo you understand?\nReceive your apartment,\nyour home.\nDo you understand?\nAnd do you want to change your life?\nI want to change my life.\nI'll tell you something.\nIt will be given to you\nthe day the money runs out.\nBut it will be written\nby the lawyer you will sign.\nIt will be scanned, it will be borrowed.\nThe day the money runs out,\ndon't tell us.\nAnd if Ricardo agrees,\ndon't tell us, don't tell me.\nI already have a single child.\nI know.\nLook, let me try to get to where I need to be.\nThe lawyer said that this thing\nabout money running out is serious,\nthat this can lead to a prison,\nwhich is not an integral prison,\nbut it can be a privation of liberty,\nwhich is a semi-open...\nHave you ever spoken to him\nabout the possibility of a treatment\nfor a person who has a problem?\nHasn't your lawyer noticed\nthat you have a problem?\nHe doesn't.\nFrom the experience he has,\nfrom the experience he has,\nhe only wants to deal with the crime of money running out.\nOnly the law.\nAnd the law is punitive.\nSo you go...\nIf you have a lawyer,\nhe should be concerned about making a defense\nand not saying that I'm cursing you.\nNo, but he wants to make a defense.\nIf he needs to know about you,\nif you are willing to collaborate...\nI am willing to collaborate\nand I will put my rules to collaborate\nif you don't follow the rules.\nI know, but when you get there,\nwhen you start to raise questions\nabout what has already happened,\nthis will generate a judgment.\nAnd from what I understand,\nthe collaboration should be...\nYou get there and say,\nno, there was a mistake,\nI made a mistake, he made a mistake,\nand that's it.\nReally?\nThat's it.\nReally, I made a mistake, he made a mistake,\nhe made a mistake, and that's it.\nDon't do that, Aline.\nI'm asking you.\nI'm asking you, don't do that.\nYou don't know what's behind it.\nI know, I know.\nYou don't know.\nI know, I know.\nI know everything.\nI work in the state.\nI know, Aline, but you don't know what's behind it.\nThe condemnation that came out there,\nif it's not the one of freedom,\nthe one of absorption,\nwill give Claudia and company\nthe weapon they need to criticize me.\nWhat I want to say to you\nin relation to money, to work, everything,\nis that there is a possibility\nof having work\nif Claudia agrees.\nIf Claudia agrees, there will be work.\nThere will be work.\nClaudia won't let us work.\nShe won't let us work.\nShe won't let us work.\nShe won't let us work,\nbut it turns out that there is an umbrella in the middle,\nand that umbrella can be used as an opportunity\nfor me to be able to work,\neven if it's against her,\nbecause she has plans,\nand I'm not part of her plans,\nand she wants to keep me away.\nSo, I even agree\nthat I may not want to participate\nin her plans anymore,\nand to leave the house\nand live somewhere else,\nI'm telling you that Uber is not bad,\nthere is no gas, but even without gas,\nI can make money,\nI'm making money,\nI just need to equalize the bills,\nbecause the money I received,\nI had to pay the debt.\nSo, introduce me.\nBut Aline, I'll introduce you,\nI would be learning things for you,\nso that you can,\nif you don't want to collaborate,\nbecause the first lawyer in the inventory said,\nif not even your brother trusts Aline,\nwhy would you trust him?\nMy brother doesn't trust anyone.\nMy brother doesn't trust anyone.\nHe didn't trust anyone,\nand he sent us out of his house several times,\nand he chose me.\nHe chose me too.\nHe chose everyone.\nHe chose me too.\nHe chose me too.\nHe chose everyone.\nAnd his allegation is that you and I\nlived our whole lives with money from Dad,\nand now he wants to get the bills right.\nIt's as if he wanted to keep everything.\nThat's it.\nIt's as if he wanted to keep everything.\nThat's why I'm not going to do...\nThat's why I'm not going to do...\nA deal with Ricardo.\nA deal with Ricardo.\nDo you know what Ricardo is going to do?\nWhen he signs...\nWhen he signs a consensual inventory,\nwhat is he going to do?\nHe's going to wait for your money to run out,\nand say,\nI don't want to sell for this price.\nBut he came here and changed the apartment key.\nHe changed the apartment key.\nBut Ricardo has a problem.\nThat's it.\nHe has a problem.\nIt's over.\nI've tried to call him,\nand in the last few days,\nevery day I try,\nand he doesn't answer.\nHe's really very angry with me.\nBut he lives...\nBecause he made a threat in his house.\nHe said,\nThere's no more soft money.\nThere's no more soft money.\nAnd he was surprised when this VGBL...\nHe didn't know that VGBL worked the way it worked.\nAnd I was full of money to pay,\nand I asked for help from him.\nHe didn't help.\nI asked for help from Letícia's father.\nI said,\nMr. Luiz, Mr. Felipe,\nhelp me, for God's sake,\nand my car bills are depending.\nAnd Mr. Felipe told me he didn't have any.\nI asked Letícia,\nI said,\nLetícia, please,\nthe car bills,\nthe car loan.\nThis month I've already paid the car loan.\nI've already paid the car insurance.\nAnd I have a reserve of at least 20,000\noutside of what's being invested.\nOkay, Cid and Ney, let's go.\nI have all the judges in the world with the money that's there.\nI'm not distributing the money\nlike I was disillusioned when I got my mother's money.\nI was disillusioned, then I rented a car,\nand then I went after companies,\nbecause I really have a problem\nthat is not just a psychological problem,\nof using drugs,\nof being temperamentally difficult,\nbut I have a sexual problem.\nI have a sexual problem.\nExactly.\nI have a sexual problem.\nThis girl who was here with me,\nshe is my friend,\nshe is over a year and a half old,\nand she also, sometimes,\nshe resents being with me\nand not being able to have a relationship with me.\nShe resents it, she gets resentful,\nshe gets sad,\nbut she understands me,\nshe tries to help me,\nshe talks to me,\nand I talk to her,\nshe also has her problems, you know?\nSo it was a friendship that I made\nand that I tried to have relationships,\nand I didn't,\nand they became friends.\nThey talk to me,\ntry to calm me down,\nand that's what I have at this moment,\nthat I can't,\nI still can't talk about this sexual problem\nwith the psychologist.\nI still can't talk about this sexual problem.\nIt didn't get to the point.\nStaying single and having sex, dear.\nLook, I've been single for six months,\na year,\nbecause I'm not,\nI'm only going to have sex when I love someone,\nwhen I get a boyfriend,\nwhen I get a nice person, you know?\nApart from that, I'd rather be single.\nIt's not possible that you can't do it.\nI'm trying.\nI'm trying.\nNakamura can do it.\nI'm trying, but...\nYou know, it's emotional balance.\nNakamura can do it.\nHe can, his wife...\nHe can't do it.\nBut Nakamura can do it.\nI've seen Nakamura at the door of...\nHow do you say it?\nThat gate in Jardim Botânico, Solário.\nI've seen Nakamura there.\nHe said, man, I'm going to do a little exercise there.\nI said, yeah, it's cool, man, it's cool.\nHe goes there, you know?\nTo look for girls.\nAnd he pays the price of the expensive girls.\nI don't do it anymore.\nI won't do it anymore.\nI won't do it anymore.\nI won't do it anymore.\nEven because it's a disappointment.\nBecause I get there and the disappointment is for me and for her.\nIt gets boring.\nThen I have to sit down, talk, say, man, I'm sorry.\nIt wasn't what I wanted, you know?\nAnd then it's a thing...\nThere's no disappointment for her.\nIt's a frustrating thing.\nEven though she's a prostitute.\nShe just wants to get her money.\nShe's not like that.\nBut I'm even more worried.\nDo you think she wants to have fun with you?\nShe doesn't want to.\nIt's not like you or Nakamura.\nMaybe...\nAnyway.\nShe dreams with Richard Gere.\nOr Naprile Oman.\nSomeone get her on the Gordeio Drive.\nMan, man.\nAnyway, I have...\nAt the end of the day, I...\nI end up sitting down, talking, apologizing.\nAnd...\nThat's it.\nToday I restricted my friendship\nwith these girls.\nWith these three girls.\nWhich are Anne.\nCarolina.\nAnd Danielle.\nWho you met at Dad's gallery.\nDanielle...\nDanielle isn't even a woman.\nShe's a transvestite.\nSo...\nThe lawyer who is dealing with this\nis an experienced lawyer.\nHe works with transvestites.\nIt was a transvestite who told me about him.\nGot it?\nSo he asked me.\nHe said, go there, talk to your sister.\nTell her that this thing in Maria da Penha\nis a complicated thing.\nAnd...\nI...\nI'm asking you.\nTo...\nThe answer he wants from me.\nHe said, ask your sister.\nIf she's willing to help you.\nI'm willing to help.\nOn the fifth day.\nOn the fifth day I'll put there\nall the rules.\nI know, Aline, but...\nWill this work?\nWhen you put...\nIt's over, Sidney. It's over.\nI won't stay...\nI know, but will this work?\nYou...\nYou wouldn't talk to him\nto know his looks?\nI'll talk...\nI'll talk to my lawyer\nto know if I can do this.\nGot it.\nIt's no use. He came...\nHe gave me the way to go there.\nI'm full of things.\nThen he keeps calling me.\nGot it?\nFrom the police station so I can go there.\nWith things.\nHe insulted me.\nHave you ever thought\nhow you fucked your mother's head?\nAnd your father's?\nHave you ever thought\nhow your mother raped you?\nWhen you put that girl...\nThat girl who committed suicide.\nWho was run over.\nShe disappeared.\nShe died.\nCaco, look.\nFor us.\nTo be loved.\nFirst we have to love each other.\nOkay.\nAnd you're empty.\nYou're crazy. You don't love each other.\nSo...\nYou're not going to be loved.\nI know.\nIf you think you deserve to go to jail,\ntell me you don't.\nBut this on condition...\nThis doesn't resolve in court.\nThis doesn't resolve in court.\nGod.\nThis doesn't resolve in court.\nLeo, don't talk\nabout this with your lawyer\nbecause you're only going to hear\nbad things about her.\nTalk to me.\nHe asked me\nif your sister would be willing to help you.\nIf you're willing\nto help me,\nhe knows\nthe way to solve this\nby getting a solution.\nNo.\nI'm willing to help.\nI know, but...\nSidney, don't go.\nIt's over.\nI'm talking to you.\nBefore I didn't even want to see your face.\nI wanted you to be arrested\nso you could fuck yourself.\nDo you think you didn't fuck yourself?\nYou fucked yourself.\nDo you know why I went to date Batista?\nBecause you beat everyone.\nPeople you loved,\nyou worshiped,\nand you started to respect me.\nNo, date Batista.\nYou think you need\npowerful people\nto be able to do something you don't need.\nYou think you need Favela\nto be able to do a project.\nYou're here wanting to fight against Claudia.\nClaudia is valuing the street.\nTo value the buildings.\nShe wants to build a closed condo.\nSo she brings the papers\nand says,\nClaudia, do you want to get Favela out of here?\nI'll leave too.\nNow,\nvalue my time.\nMy time is to make money to pay my son's bills.\nBecause the son of a bitch is enough for Andrea.\nNow, what happened in my life\nwas the following.\nI had to reach a limit\nto be able to say,\nit's over.\nAnd the limit was the following.\nIt was your father who solved it.\nIt was your father.\nEither he\nwill be treated\nand will be inserted in the family\nand we will do everything for him,\nor he can follow\nhis own life.\nOr he can follow his own life,\nI don't want to know anymore.\nSo, did you get treated?\nDid you run away from one, run away from another?\nI'm being treated.\nI have a psychiatrist.\nI have a psychologist.\nI'm being treated.\nI'm being treated.\nYou didn't go for the exam, Sidney.\nYou have a neurological psychological problem.\nWhere is the result of the exam?\nThe psychological exam\nwas initiated\nand after\nI was\ndoing the procedure,\nthe doctor changed.\nAnd the doctor who showed up,\nI didn't\nfeel like being with her.\nAnd then\nwhat happens is\nI need to find another\nspace\nto do the neuro-psychological exam.\nI'm\nbusy there,\nbut I have arrived very late\nat home.\nYesterday I left at 9 o'clock\nand I got home at 7 o'clock\nin the morning.\nI still had time to go to the market,\nto buy coconut water,\norange juice,\nso I wouldn't leave my son without a coffee,\nwithout anything,\nbecause there was no milk there,\nthere was no butter,\nthere was no butter.\nThere is butter, yes.\nThere may not be much, but there was\nthe rest of the butter left at the bakery.\nAnd there was milk.\nAnd look, it's time, my son is\n16 years old,\nI go there every day, I cook\nfor him, every day\nI go home, I don't know what this\nboy does. I spend the whole day\nin the video game. It's over\nfor him. It's over\nfor him. If he doesn't fit in,\nhe's going to get depressed\nand he's going to show\nthat he's having a hard time\nand he's going to treat\nhim. Or so, because the problem\neveryone has. I believe\nthe problem everyone has.\nI have, you have,\nI have.\nHow are we going to deal with the problem\nis what is important.\nSo, Sidney, look,\nI have no intention\nto put you\nin jail. So let's\nunderstand that... I'm not going to talk\nto the lawyer before the hearing.\nI'm not going to talk to the lawyer before the hearing.\nI'm going to do\nhere, I'm going to do\nwhat I\nwant,\nwhat I need you to\ncommit yourself to,\nso we can\ncontinue the hearing.\nThis will be talked about.\nI know, but look.\nThis lawyer of yours,\nshe's not the best person\nto advise you.\nThe day I was\narrested, she sent a message\nthat was not answered.\nSidney, I'm here\nto talk to you. The terms\nof what you can do,\nas if I, as if\nshe could\ndictate what I should\nor shouldn't do.\nI chose not to answer her\nand even\nwith all the difficulties,\nwithout the money, without\nanything, I went, I went\nto the fight to see what happened.\nSidney, I don't have a lawyer.\nI don't have a lawyer.\nI had a lawyer\nfrom Professor João Pedro\nand he was helping me. My lawyer\nis public defender.\nSo, let's go.\nWhat about the car\nloan, whatever,\neverything else?\nI'm going to pay.\nI'm going to talk to the lawyer.\nNo, but it was clear.\nI don't need it anymore.\nI don't need it anymore.\nThat was everything.\nThat was the arguments\nI used to get\nthe GBL out of the bank\nfaster.\nThe GBL, they are forced\nto release immediately.\nSo, it was\none of the arguments I had\ncoming there and talking\nto be able to see\nwhat was going on.\nYes, Sidney, but look.\nBecause it takes time.\nIt's an electronic process.\nBecause Ricardo\ndragged his\nprocess to mine.\nAnd the emails\nthat\ndemand,\ndemand documents\nthat go to Ricardo, came to me.\nIt's been more than a month\nthese emails coming.\nThey asked for more documents\nto Ricardo, more documents to Ricardo.\nThey asked for a lot of documents\nfor me too.\nI think they didn't release Ricardo.\nI think they didn't release Ricardo.\nMaybe, maybe now\nat this moment.\nMaybe now at this moment\nthey released him. Do you know why?\nBecause\nthe thing there\nworks automatically.\nSo, sometimes the money\nis released and continues\nto arrive, email.\nAnd then the orientation\nof the person in the inventory\nof the bank was\ndon't answer, Sidney.\nWhat has already been resolved is already resolved.\nSo, exactly.\nBut look, I'm not here\nto\nfuck with anyone.\nI'm not here to be able to\nRicardo came to open the apartment thinking\nI want to leave.\nI'm not even going to stay in Rio de Janeiro.\nGot it?\nNow, what did Ricardo do\nto send the\njob to block the account?\nBut everything my father did\nand talked about, he said\nRicardo, got it?\nSo, everything\nmy father did, we almost thought.\nWhen he was still\nbetter off.\nGot it?\nSo, Ricardo, you\nentered\nthe account without authorization\nand so on and so on. He called the manager\nand the manager said, no, no, no.\nMy father came here\nand signed\nand was interrogated\nand answered. I was with\nso, so\nin full\ncapacity\nto answer\nand make the decision.\nSo, I'm not here.\nSidney, money\nin my life is not\nthe most important thing. Ricardo has a very\nbad relationship with money.\nI'm not going to discuss that.\nGot it? I'm not going to discuss it.\nNow, I don't want to be stuck\nin an inventory\nwith Ricardo and you. Got it?\nAnd now Ricardo is trying to\nstop you just to\nfight.\nGot it? He's trying to stop you just\nto fight. Got it?\nAnd say that he has\npower, because he thinks I want to\nstop you. Got it?\nSo, I want to know, first\nwho took the folder.\nGot it? I'm going there\nin Maria da Penha, I'm going to do a\nB.O.A. Got it?\nSo, I'm here\nto be able to solve things with love.\nWith love.\nLove.\nBut don't ask me, Sidney.\nDon't ask me, you know why?\nBecause it involves a lot of things.\nIncluding Ricardo mixing me up.\nI don't know what you're going to want to know,\nman.\nI'm going to put a limit on the person.\nDo you think the person is going to mistreat me?\nIt's over. I don't want...\nIt's over. I'm going to go up, I'm going to pay\nJoão Pedro's school. It's over.\nI went to heaven, I asked for a discount.\nGive me a discount, please.\nMy father said, if I'm unemployed,\nbecause I was taking care of my father,\nthey gave me a 50% discount.\nSo, I talked to João Pedro.\nRicardo is not going to pay school\nto say, I'm good,\nI'm taking João Pedro.\nBecause he's shitting.\nHe doesn't like anyone. He doesn't even like his wife\nor his son.\nHe doesn't lick Leticia the way he licks.\nHe doesn't drink the way he drinks.\nHe doesn't cause any confusion in the street.\nSo, Ricardo has a problem.\nHe has a problem.\nHe has a problem with the psychiatrist.\nI call everyone to report.\nRicardo sucks.\nEverything Ricardo does wrong,\nI have here.\nDoes he think he's going to fuck me up?\nI'm going to drink Coca-Cola.\nI'm not here to fuck anyone up.\nBut, you know,\nwhen the bucket is filling up,\nand then comes the limit.\nBut in the moment\nthat you\nwalk in this way,\nthis will generate a condemnation.\nDo you think you're going to the audience?\nNo, you're going to the audience.\nOf course you have to go to the audience.\nYou have to go.\nYou have to go.\nAnd Ricardo, go there.\nI want to quote you.\nSo, you have to go.\nI have to go. He has to go.\nBecause he has a testimony.\nThe three of us have to go.\nBut what I wanted\nis that you\nunderstand that\nthis can generate\na punishment.\nAnd this punishment can be\npunishment of restriction of freedom.\nThere is no alternative punishment\nYou've thought about it.\nYou've thought about it.\nYou're crazy about it.\nI'm not, Aline.\nThis is how it works.\nI'm not reading electronics.\nI'm not reading electronics.\nLet me tell you something.\nI'm not reading electronics.\nI have a headache.\nI'm full of pain in my body.\nI've been discussing it for an hour.\nYou came in here.\nI came in, I closed the key.\nYou came in.\nYou didn't ring the bell.\nI did ring the bell.\nI did ring the bell.\nYou came in.\nI did ring the bell.\nI don't want to discuss it with you.\nI'm not here to...\nI've already said it.\nNow, thank God,\nmy father died that day.\nThank God,\nmy father died.\nI'm calmer.\nNow,\nyou have to do the treatment.\nIt's over.\nI'm doing the treatment, Aline.\nYou didn't do the tests, Sidney.\nYou didn't do anything.\nYou're doing the treatment\nin a place that I didn't know.\nI don't know how you're going to the treatment.\nIn the other car.\nIt's over.\nSo, Sidney, take a load\nfrom your therapist.\nYou'll have to do an evaluation.\nThe evaluation will have to be\nby the municipality.\nThe state doesn't work in the municipality, dear.\nIt's going to be by the municipality.\nYou gave it your all.\nThe family clinic, everyone wanting to help you.\nNow, Aline, I was wrong.\nMan, you were wrong.\nWhat kind of evaluation\ndo you think\nthis will give?\nWill it give an interdiction to me?\nNo.\nLook, Ricardo only\nbelieves if I sign it.\nIf you tell me, Aline,\nI don't want\nyou to try to get any money.\nBut\nI'm going to sign a term here\nsaying that if my money runs out\nI'm not going to look for you.\nI'm going to become a beggar.\nOf course.\nOtherwise you'll disturb everyone.\nNo, Aline, no.\nYou'll disturb everyone.\nNo, Aline, no.\nI don't have the money I used to have.\nSo\nI earn\nI work, I earn.\nAnd I think I earn little.\nAnd I have the intention to earn more.\nBut for my intention\nthen you say\nthe project\nyou're going to get involved with Claudia's business.\nYes.\nBut Claudia is making money.\nAlexandre\nAlexandre\nAlexandre\nis listed in the Rato's\nThe name of his\nis Marujo.\nSo it's not good, Sidney.\nHe is corrupt.\nEveryone is, Sidney.\nWhat he\ncan be doing behind\nof a judge\nof a promoter\nyou don't know.\nYour brother is too.\nEveryone is.\nI'm not. I'm sure.\nI have difficulty paying my bills\nbut I never accepted.\nI never accepted.\nMoney, scheme.\nIt may be that Ricardo\nis in agreement with Gordo.\nIt may be that he has made a deal\nwith Gordo.\nHe's getting in the wrong with everyone.\nHe's getting in the wrong with Gordo.\nGordo wants to sell. Gordo runs away from him.\nI don't know.\nHe has\nI'm telling you.\nHe told me that he closed\na business in China\nthat he earned money for a fool\nthat he's not worried about the money.\nBut I don't know\nHe closed a business in China\nand he's saying that he earns money for a fool.\nBut I know.\nBut he has his schemes.\nI don't know what his schemes are.\nIf he messes with me\nI'll knock on his door\nand I'll say\ntell Ricardo to stop\npissing me off.\nBecause besides putting Maria da Pen on him\nI'll\nI'll put my mouth on another.\nI don't want to\nCaco, let me tell you.\nMy life is not easy.\nRicardo, I'm tired of asking him for help.\nHe never helped me.\nNot even in the Epson process.\nNot even in the Epson process.\nNot even in the João Pedro process.\nIt's his son.\nHe never stopped\nto look at the process.\nDo you know what I did?\nHe needed\nan indication\nto get Malagut's account.\nHe says\nI would have called Flávia.\nFlávia doesn't answer\nbecause she has nothing to do with him.\nI called and said\nMaria, give me some help.\nFlávia called and at the same time\nMalagut put him there.\nRicardo has a problem.\nHe thinks he's the winner.\nRicardo, I have an account\nthat I gave you.\nWhen I talk to him\nI have the whole story.\nWhen I talk to him\nhe says\nyou're being cruel.\nYou're playing\nlike this.\nThen he drinks.\nI never did anything bad to him.\nBecause he must have hate.\nBecause\nmy father helped us.\nThat's it.\nThat's his hate.\nHe thinks he has accounts\nto get right.\nHe won't get any account.\nBecause you need it.\nMy father gave his life.\nHe gave his life.\nHe won't get any account\nbecause you need it\nand because I need it.\nI decided to get married\nand live in Campinas with Dadinho\nbecause João Pedro was\nin love with us\nand my parents asked me\nnot to live in Campinas.\nSo\nJoão Pedro\nwill be my father\nand André will be my father.\nI already have\n300 thousand\nthat I can get from André\nwith minimum wage.\nMy process was to get\na minimum wage\nbut André never paid.\nMy planilha is\n309 thousand.\nIt should be 310 thousand.\n312 thousand. I don't know.\nI'm going to get André's house.\nI'm going to get André's house\nin the court\nand it will be the property of João Pedro.\nI'm not here.\nDo you think I want...\nI put money in this apartment.\nI renovated.\nMy father put too.\nNo!\nRicardo said...\nThis closet...\nI paid for it.\nThe day he came here\nhe told me that he did a job\nand we want to get in line.\nHe's trying.\nI don't know\nwhat he did.\nSidney,\nlook...\nIf he asked for my intervention.\nBut I think...\nHe gave me an entrance. I'll tell you what happened.\nHe gave me an entrance.\nHe asked for my intervention?\nHe gave me an entrance back there.\nAnd then what happened?\nHe stopped the process.\nBecause he's vulgar.\nBecause he doesn't understand anything about family.\nHe's too powerful.\nHe gave me an entrance.\nLook, Sidney.\nIf I don't sign, he doesn't forbid you.\nI know.\nBut he has a new process.\nLet me tell you.\nHe gave me an entrance.\nAnd then what did he do?\nHe stopped the process.\nBecause if he asked for your intervention\nhe would have to answer.\nDo you understand?\nNo.\nIf he asked for your intervention\nhe would have to pay all the costs.\nYes.\nHe would have to support you for the rest of your life.\nYes.\nBut what does he want?\nWhat did we talk about?\nIt's like this.\nRicardo wanted you\nto put yourself\nin Recreio's apartment\nand give me a table for you.\nAnd then I said, man,\nno, no, for me I want Sidney to deal with it.\nThe way it is,\nhe's at 200,\n220, 440,\nhe's going to hit his head on the post,\nhe's going to die, you know?\nHe could even think it's good for him to die.\nAnyway, because\nminus one to divide mine.\nBut Sidney, in the end,\nyou're my brother.\nObviously I love you.\nThere's no way you can't love your family.\nNow you're just\nrespecting me.\nNow you painted and embroidered.\nAnd in fact it wasn't now, it wasn't the whole life.\nBecause I take the history here\nof you mumbling.\nYou called me at dawn mumbling.\nYou called me a failure.\nThe whole life.\nSo you needed to get to that point.\nAnd look, God is too great.\nBecause my father needed\nnot to be able to\nmanage his life anymore.\nHe needed my father to be fragile\nto be able to say\nI don't want it anymore.\nI can't take it anymore.\nMy father said, I can't take it anymore.\nHow many times did you come in and out of the house?\nHow many times did you come in and\nknock on the door?\nDid you call\nSão Paulo to support the room?\nDid you always\ncomfort everyone?\nWait, Sidney.\nCalm down.\nI'm talking.\nNo, Sidney.\nYou have to understand that\nthis caused\na mess.\nThe whole world.\nIncluding João Pedro.\nDo you know what happened to my parents?\nIt's from the França Miranda family.\nDon't solve\nthings.\nIt's from the França Miranda family.\nDon't solve things.\nNow you're talking\nto me and this is normal.\nAnd now you're talking to me.\nYou're another person, Sidney.\nYou enter in silence\ninside the house.\nYou give a discharge.\nYou didn't give a discharge.\nYou give a discharge\nand you leave the bathroom clean.\nYou wash the dishes.\nIt got to the point where you\nbroke the glass, called Tatiana\nand said, get this.\nTatiana,\nthe person gets\nat least one hour.\nWakes up at four in the morning.\nYou don't have\n...\nYour speech is beautiful, but\n...\nIt's not speech.\nYou don't have respect for the next person.\nI know, Sidney, but\nit's not speech.\nI just want you\nnot to adjust\nClaudia to do her plans.\nFrom the moment\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nBecause he, suddenly, in that situation, he didn't say it to you, but he said it to me,\nhe thought he was going to go out there, something that would distract him from his routine.\nI didn't think so, you know why? Because I talked to him and said,\nDad, do you want the car to come back?\nI mean, I'm going out, there's no problem.\nI said, no, daughter, I want you.\nThe joy of the house, look, after ten o'clock I went to the fridge,\nI brought the fridge from the producer, you know what, daughter?\nAfter ten o'clock, it's amazing.\nYou have no idea what it was.\nYou have no idea how many internazions,\nyou have no idea how many prostitutes I went with dad.\nYou have no idea, you know why?\nYou were going there and you only disturbed the internazion of you.\nDad, it's me, it's me.\nYou never went there, Dad, today I have to give you love.\nDo you understand, Sidney?\nYou need to look and build values that were not built by you.\nEverything is fine there, just think.\nReally, this is the most important thing.\nIt's weighing, and what I have to tell you is,\nthis will give more space for Manga,\nwith something that is an objective,\nan urban objective, an objective of the city,\na vision of the city, where it was planned,\ninside the Miga Pereira, where Cláudia sat,\nAlexandre Reis, the little bear, the son of the judge,\nand another half of the people, they made a plan there,\nand it was the fight with this plan.\nAnd in their plan, they had to choose the enemy.\nWho is the enemy?\nYou're kidding, man, this is a way of persecution.\nNo, it's not.\nMy brother looks, apologizes, this is a way of persecution.\nDidn't you say he had a dossier against me?\nHe has a dossier against you,\nof all the viruses you got in the street.\nAnd there are great things, they can have a dossier,\nwhat they want.\nWere they a delegation from the board?\nThe complaint they gave, did the process work?\nIt didn't work.\nSo much so that I was arrested,\nand the custody agency released me,\nbecause you're going to pull the historical record,\ndoes your brother have a problem with justice?\nNo, so he's not a person who has to be arrested.\nOh, that's dangerous.\nYeah, he doesn't have to be arrested.\nLet me tell you something, did you respond to the process?\nNo, because...\nI don't know what you're talking about.\nThere's nothing you can say, I'm going to ask Claudia...\nActually, I'm not going to ask Claudia anything.\nI'm going to put her in her place.\nNo, I didn't respond to the process.\nShe's going to send a petition.\nI didn't respond to the process,\nI didn't respond to the process,\nbecause everything that was taken to the police,\nthe first time it was a threat,\nbecause I insisted,\nI went after them to try to negotiate,\nand I wanted, I wanted, I wanted,\nand they kicked me out, out, out,\none day I went up to Christmas,\nand I was desperate,\nbecause my dad, all his life,\nwas pressing me, you have to work, you have to work, you have to work,\nand I saw an exit in that favela situation,\nand I was pressing them, pressing them,\nand they ignored me as if I were an idiot,\nand one day I went up drunk on Christmas,\nand I went to her door and cursed.\nShe got the delegate,\nwhich is not a normal thing,\nbut she got the delegate to make a complaint.\nThere was an audience of conciliation,\nthat was with Gekrinho,\nand I got there,\nlook, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\nand the process died, the archival process.\nBut she made a complaint,\nbecause you already have the precedent\nof not disturbing...\nNo, but I know, but I understand,\nbut every complaint she makes,\nhas to generate a process,\nand that has to take place, and the end...\nShe didn't take place, because...\nShe didn't take place, because in fact,\nnobody wants to fuck you, Carlos.\nI know, but...\nI just want that...\nSo what?\nSo what?\nSo what?\nLook, after you have fixed all this mess,\ndo you think they will open up space?\nI learned something in the state, Cid.\nI had everything to attack.\nThere is a person,\nwho was fired along with me,\nwho keeps threatening,\nshe went back to the state.\nShe knows things,\nshe keeps threatening.\nI never said anything,\nI collected myself,\nI'm in mine,\nI didn't post anything,\nI didn't say anything,\nnow they are calling me back.\nI'm not going, because they exonerated me.\nI'm going back to the state,\nto another place,\nto the place where I will deliver the projects\nthat I have to be able to deliver.\nNow, stay quiet from yours.\nIn a little while I will be in the state,\ndoing the lighting project.\nI'm tired of helping you, Cid.\nI'm tired of helping you.\nI'm tired of helping you.\nThen you go there,\nyou were doing the project,\nthen you leave the project,\nthen you got into the hospital,\nyou were run over,\nthen it became a mess.\nSo, you get in the way,\nyou are much smarter than me and Ricardo together.\nI was, I was.\nBut you don't have emotional intelligence,\nCid.\nI'm going to talk about you,\nyou were really helped by you.\nRicardo also tried to help me,\nwith his humility,\nhe said, Cid, come here,\nget me a computer,\nhe paid me very little,\nhe paid me very little,\nbut he gave me an occupation.\nI didn't have the measure\nof what you were doing with me,\nof what you were doing with me,\nmaybe I could have given more than me,\nbut this has a lot of my,\nof my shyness,\nthings that I lost\nnow working with Uber.\nI now,\nI now had to face\na job\nwith Uber,\nwhere I missed several times,\nUber caught my attention\nseveral times,\nCid, you talk too much.\nIt's in school, of course it's in school,\nand when it's like this,\nyou can't talk to me,\nyou keep calling, you don't know\nthat I don't have internet on this phone,\nwhen I don't have internet,\nthe message doesn't come in,\nyou're tired of knowing that, my son,\nso you keep calling, you know,\nI sent a lot of messages\nyou didn't receive,\ngo to school and keep calling,\nyou have a phone for that.\nUber sent a lot of messages,\nand I was correcting\nwith time,\nI was correcting,\nso today I know how to\ntreat the client,\nI know my place,\nto position myself,\nI had never worked\nlike this,\nwhere I needed,\nreally needed\nto keep the job,\nand then,\nwith this need,\nI was broken by Uber,\nUber is\na platform\nthat warns\nbefore taking an attitude,\nto block these things,\nand it was changing me,\ntoday I'm an Uber driver,\nalmost platinum level,\nwhere I can choose\nthe area I work,\nwhere I can\nput the car in the break,\nand even\nwhen I'm using Bermuda,\nI still get,\nlast week\nI got R$53\nof cash,\nit's a lot of cash,\na lot of cash that can be given,\nit's simple,\ncongratulations,\ncongratulations, I'm happy\nto hear that,\nI'm happy to hear that,\nI just want you to take it into consideration,\nI will take it into consideration,\nI'm not here to fuck you,\nI'm not here to put anyone\nin jail,\nbut you have to be careful with justice,\nI don't have to be careful with justice,\nI know how to manage\nthings,\nso that\nyou have\nthe result you need,\nyes, but the result I need\nI'm already doing,\nyou've improved a lot,\ntreatment,\nbut let me\ntalk, man,\nI'm in pain, I'm all fucked up,\nI can't stay here,\nthe whole house, the bathroom,\nis full of things,\nof your stupidity,\nyou know,\nGod,\nit's a pig,\nit's a pig,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nshe's a beast,\nshe's a beast,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nAline is mine,\nshe's a woman of my life,\nshe's mine,\nI know, Aline,\nshe's not a bitch,\nshe's my friend,\nshe's my friend,\nshe's just a woman,\na woman,\nI don't know if it was a mistake, but it was because I didn't fix the mistake.\nIf I had fixed the mistake, she would have corrected it.\nI'm counting on you, to be able to solve this on the day of the hearing.\nSo that there is no reason for Claudia to be glorifying what she did.\nI'm counting on you, to be able to solve this on the day of the hearing.\nIt's not a mistake, it's a mistake.\nYou caused a lot of trouble, I had to leave home early, I lived in my friends' house.\nEveryone is very stupid.\nClaudia has a project.\nI know, but her project will harm half the world.\nIf her project will harm half the world, it will harm the world.\nShe managed to create an urban reform.\nThis urban reform can both benefit you and Claudia.\nThe urban reform...\nThe urban reform she wants is to transport VLT in front of Miguel Pereira.\nIt would make her life easier.\nIt would make her life easier.\nIt would ruin everyone's life for two or three years.\nIt would ruin everyone's life for two or three years.\nYes, but do you know...\nHave you sat down with Ricardo to know if he will want to wait three years to sell the property?\nNo.\nBecause until now, what is in that property is IPTU.\nIt's IPTU Gas and Light.\nAnd what about this plane?\nThat's true. I don't want to pay for it.\nI don't want to pay for it either.\nI don't want to pay for it either.\nI don't think this project will come out because there won't be any money.\nAnyway, the guy is messing around.\nExactly.\nThe guy is messing around.\nLook, here's the document.\nHere's her document asking...\nYou asked for the document, I stopped here to show you.\nShe asked for the street to be transformed into a closed street.\nHere.\nAsking for what?\nAsking for the residents.\nShe sent...\nYou know she...\nShe has to be unanimous.\nYes, she sent it to circulate to everyone.\nYes.\nSo she needs the votes of everyone.\nNow she doesn't need it anymore because there's a law where...\nIf...\nIf 60% agree, she can take action.\nSo much so that she...\nBut I can make a movement against it.\nYou can.\nYou can.\nThen I can say, look, Cláudia, I'm not in favor of it.\nExactly.\nBut she...\nBut she...\nI know.\nBut if you go against her, she'll want to turn into your enemy too.\nLook here.\nWait.\nHere's the document.\nI don't need Cláudia for anything.\nHere's the document.\nPlease read it for your safety.\nI don't know how I do it.\nI'll send it to you.\nSend it to João Pedro so he can send it to me.\nI'll send it to Cláudia and say,\nCláudia, I didn't receive this correspondence.\nNo, I'm not going to say anything now.\nI have a lot of problems to solve.\nYes, I think it's better if you...\nIf you want, I'll send all the documents.\nThe organic cycle.\nEverything.\nYes, I can go there too.\nI can cause a lot of...\nI can delay her life.\nYou can?\nI don't know, all the processes I'm in the States...\nSo, I can...\nI can do that.\nI can even say, look, I'm not in a hurry.\nBut...\nDo you want to close the street to be able to work with the condo?\nI want to see all the accounts.\nThe account has to be open.\nI want to see all the accounts.\nAll the expenses of the street to be able to know if I want to work with that.\nI'm not in a hurry.\nI'm going to say that I'm going to make a movement against it.\nI'm going to send you...\nI'm going to send everything to João Pedro.\nIt's over.\nAnd then you take care of everything.\nBut we have to have people...\nAnd I'm not even going to say that you're not in a hurry.\nYou're going to go to the bank.\nAnd then you're going to start arguing.\nYou're going to say, no, it's money.\nCome on.\nIt's going to be a mess.\nWhy do we laugh at that?\nNo.\nThere are a lot of people who don't have money to pay for the condo.\nNot even to pay.\nThat's right.\nI could pay.\nBut you made so much trouble that I almost paid.\nYou made so much trouble that I almost stopped paying.\nBut I thought it was good.\nWhat was the price of the condo there?\nIt was...\nIt was 150.\nBut it was increasing progressively.\nToday it must be about 500.\nI think it's very expensive.\nIt's the contribution to the housing association.\nApart from the fact that she passes the book...\nThe little book to be able to collect for that land there.\nI never even sat there.\nAnd apart from that she uses those guards\nas a common denominator for discussion.\nWhy?\nIt's in those guards that the discussion happens\nand where she can add people.\nWhy?\nBecause the guards want to receive.\nAnd there are people who don't want to pay.\nThat's right.\nSo we don't pay.\nThey want to receive.\nAnd then it becomes a passive worker.\nIt becomes a passive worker.\nBut passive this worker\nthat could have been resolved\nback when I talked to them.\nI said, guys, keeping this guy there is complicated.\nI went to the meeting, I put a letter,\nI said, it's complicated.\nThe guy is getting involved.\nNow she must know that.\nIf she becomes a condo, she forces everyone\nand she makes everyone work with a retroactive.\nExactly.\nShe wants to make everyone, all units, work with a retroactive.\nI'll say, look, I'm a resident.\nI've never collaborated with her.\nBut then it's part of her plan\nto put you out.\nSell the house.\nDo you know, do you know if in this inventory\nthat Ricardo is running,\nhe is requesting my interdiction?\nI haven't had access to this document yet.\nIt's ready.\nYeah, I know.\nMarcel Picuca gave me a lawyer.\nHe's asking me to do it.\nBut I agree with the request of you two.\nI don't want to put a lawyer in it.\nBecause he wants 15%.\nThe other one wanted 10%.\nThe other one wanted 10%.\nThen after he asked for 10%, he came with a story.\nOh, but now that you've received the money...\nMarcel Picuca is very complicated.\nHe's already had a conflict.\nHe's already had a conflict.\nHe's already had a conflict with the producer.\nHe's already had a conflict with the producer.\nHe's already had a conflict with the producer.\nHe's not a person who doesn't sign anything.\nAnd you say, sorry, I'm coming.\nBecause he's very complicated.\nYeah, he could be with the lawyer since the hole.\nI don't think so.\nI think he's going to be upset with you.\nMaybe not, right?\nMaybe not.\nYeah, maybe it's not the same as the 4,000.\nTake him away.\nI'm not going away.\nYou took the keys from the house.\nSo you don't say you didn't come in because you don't have the keys.\nHave you already given it to João Pedro?\nNo, but I can leave one here and take the other one to him.\nThat's it, take the keys to him.\nNow it's 40 reais.\nI'm going to pay.\nNo, you don't have to.\nI'm going to pay.\nNo, you don't.\nI'm going to pay.\nNo, you don't.\nOh, okay.\nI'm so tired.\nI'm tired of you.\nI don't like anyone.\nI don't like anyone.\nI'm talking to you.\nThe dialogue is usually...\nYou're going to tell me that you don't want to apologize.\nNo.\nYou're going to apologize that...\nNo, I'm putting you in reality. That's why you haven't understood yet.\nI'm not even there for Claudia, but the people behind her, who are the big constructors, are there for Claudia.\nShe will see if she can do it.\nShe can.\nDid you also lose the key to the door of this apartment?\nWhat?\nDid you lose the key to the door of this apartment?\nDude, I don't know where the key is.\nYeah.\nI don't know where the key is.\nYou have to lock the door of the apartment, because the door is open.\nThe door is open, yes.\nOkay.\nThe door is open.\nI'm not going to call anyone here.\nThe door is open.\nThe door is open.\nYeah.\nThe door is open.\n --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters",

it.\nAfter you didn't want to.\nI went to talk to the lawyer.\nI said.\nSo.\nCan you receive it from João Pedro?\nAs a grandson.\nSince the father is absent.\nOnly if you declare yourself incapable.\nIf I declare myself incapable.\nI don't work in the state.\nI don't have a company.\nYou know?\nThen I can't work.\nBecause of.\nI don't know.\nSix thousand reais.\nIt's not worth it.\nNow you could have that.\nAnd have your car.\nMake your Uber.\nLive your life.\nFuck.\nSo many people.\nSet up a scheme.\nTo be able to.\nAn interdiction.\nFake.\nYou know?\nA.\nI know.\nI know.\nBecause no one can take anything.\nI know.\nThe process of inventing is a very serious thing.\nNo one can come and take what is yours.\nI know.\nNo one can take what is yours.\nBut it happens.\nThat I prefer it to be done.\nThe right way.\nYou don't have the ability to manage your life.\nI'm managing my life.\nI'm managing my life.\nI go out every day to work.\nI spent the whole night working.\nMy earnings in Uber.\nLast week it was two thousand.\nLast week it was one thousand and five hundred.\nSo introduce me.\nNo, no.\nStart putting things together.\nI'll send you a list of things.\nBecause the car is all broken.\nBut the car is all broken.\nThat doesn't mean anything, Aline.\nThe Uber experience is not just the car.\nThe Uber experience is the driver.\nIt's how I drive.\nDo you think you're going to work on it?\nOf course not, Aline.\nOf course not.\nOf course not.\nAnd what are your plans?\nOf course not.\nMy plans, Aline.\nIs that I can work as an architect.\nAs an architect planner.\nI would like to do what my dad did.\nArchitecture planning.\nBut I have some things going on.\nBecause Claudia has an idea.\nAnd I have another idea.\nAnd then we share ideas.\nMe and Claudia.\nGot it?\nAnd she has a goal of not...\nGot it?\nThis was last week.\nIt was February 12th, February 19th.\nWhich was the time of the carnival.\nWhich was all dynamic.\nBut that's it.\nHere, the income is weekly.\nThis here, 1500.\nIt's not bad.\nBut the car, 1145.\nIt's not bad.\nBut the car.\nBut the car drinks a lot.\nSo what's left is little.\nYou could have had a lot.\nWhen you bought this car.\nYou should have put the gas first.\nI know.\nNobody liked uv.\nGot it?\nGasoline.\nI know, Aline.\nBut it's rich.\nI know.\nI'm not rich.\nBut the gas makes some transformations in the car.\nIt makes holes in the engine block.\nAnd this car, when I bought it.\nIt had some electrical problems.\nAnd I'm still afraid.\nAnd it's not the time yet.\nYou have to take it to a car service.\nOr sell this car and get another one.\nThat's what I can think about.\nBut I'm part of a group of uber drivers.\nAnd the boys, even driving all day.\nDriving all night.\nTheir average is 400, 300 per day.\nThe ideal is to use my education.\nTo get clients who pay me to travel.\nThe other day the girl offered me.\nDo you want to take me to Terezópolis?\nThat's the kind of person I need.\nI have an evaluation in the uber.\nAn evaluation that is a little strange for me to understand.\nBecause it seems that people feel sorry for me.\nThey give me money, but they don't give me praise.\nOf course.\nBecause you don't drive very well.\nNo, no, no.\nI know, Aline.\nBut if I said I drove badly.\nI had already been expelled from the passport.\nNo, no, no.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nPeople feel sorry for you.\nBecause, come on.\nFirst you do uber black.\nYou don't dress according to uber black.\nMaybe, Aline.\nAnd the behavior within the uber.\nMaybe.\nIt's not uber black.\nSo it's good you have...\nMaybe, maybe.\nMaybe you're right.\nBut I prefer that my personality prevails.\nAnd my evaluation in general is good.\nBecause people thank me every time they get out of the car.\nThank you for the conversation.\nThank you for the sincerity.\nThank you.\nIt's how I am.\nI say what I think.\nYou're the kind of person who has a huge heart.\nSo I have a huge heart.\nBut you have to know that the huge heart doesn't solve.\nI know.\nMan, you have to treat yourself.\nAnd you don't know how to treat yourself.\nYou think you don't have a problem.\nAnd I have a problem.\nI do.\nBut Aline, I'm doing treatment.\nI don't know where you get it from that I don't do treatment.\nI'm going to the psychologist every week.\nEvery week to the psychologist.\nBut look, Aline.\nYou ran from the people at the clinic.\nI ran because the family clinic is not the IPUB.\nThe family clinic is not the IPUB.\nAnd the IPUB is not what it used to be.\nI'm going back to Maria da Penha.\nAnd I'm going to do a B.O.\nThat opened the apartment.\nAnd they took my papers from here.\nIncluding my folder.\nWith all the history.\nEverything I'm doing is for your good.\nI'm not going to put you in jail.\nAline, go ahead.\nLook, I understand one thing.\nYou're going to jail.\nI'm going to jail.\nGo ahead.\nDo you know why?\nBecause you don't have the measure.\nYou don't have the measure of what Maria da Penha's law is.\nI do.\nI do.\nYou have to...\nI do.\nI would like...\nI have the measure of what Maria da Penha's law is.\nAnd I'm a friend of the woman's secretary.\nSo?\nNo.\nLook.\nNo one is here to fuck anyone.\nI know, but...\nThe rules exist to be respected.\nI know.\nDo you think I talk to anyone?\nThat I mess with people?\nI didn't talk to anyone.\nNot even to the secretary.\nNot even to the governor.\nDo you understand?\nNot even to the bitch who gave birth.\nI know.\nAnd I'm holding everything.\nNow, Kako.\nI know.\nI'm not going back to being in jail.\nMaria da Penha's sentence...\nIt may not generate an entire prison.\nBut it can generate a prison...\nA prison in half.\nI can...\nHave a semi-open.\nOr be forced to go to sleep.\nTake my freedom.\nNo.\nBe forced to go to sleep.\nNo, Aline.\nDon't mess with Maria da Penha's law.\nLook.\nYou...\nYou're a thinker.\nYou spend your whole life being fucked up.\nYou fuck everyone's life.\nAline, I'm not fucked up.\nAline, I'm not fucked up.\nDo you think all your behavior is...\nAline, I'm not fucked up.\nI'm not fucked up.\nIt's hard to talk to someone like that.\nIt's hard because I'm not fucked up.\nAline, I graduated from a college.\nI'm a graduate.\nThank God.\nSo...\nI'm talking to you.\nI graduated from a college.\nI graduated from a college.\nI'm a graduate.\nSo, at that time, there was no drugs.\nThere was no shit.\nThere was no drugs.\nI graduated after graduation.\nThere was no drugs.\nI did specialization at UF.\nThere was no drugs.\nI went with Rita.\nRita today is president of the water company of Maricá.\nRita liked me.\nShe saw my difficulty.\nSidney is a good-hearted person, but she has difficulty.\nSo, I'm going to help him.\nRita helped me with the projects.\nBut the coordinator of the program didn't want to stay with me.\nShe didn't want to stay with me.\nAnd Rita doesn't answer me anymore.\nBut I didn't have...\nI had the ability to do specialization after graduation.\nI didn't have drugs.\nThere is no consistency of drugs.\nAnd so much of it is true.\nWhat do I bring?\nWhat kind of drug do you bring in Santa Marta?\nI don't know.\nBut isn't it so much constant?\nSidney, let me tell you something.\nI know everyone.\nAll the places you go to.\nI go there too.\nBut I go there in a different way.\nI go to the project.\nI know.\nI go there with the basics.\nI go there with...\nYou know?\nLight for people.\nI know.\nWe have a choice.\nWe can go to the worst and bring light.\nI know.\nWe have a choice in life, man.\nDo you think you don't have a problem?\nYou can even bring the drug dealer from Santa Marta.\nAnd he said, look, the boy really came here and bought.\nHe bought, I don't know, 50 reais of marijuana and took it home.\nBecause it was the way I had, that I was having, to calm me down.\nIt was a calming that I had.\nWhat do you think about this calming without...\nAline, I know, but look, understand.\nIf I were independent...\nDid you self-medicate?\nAs if I had done that.\nIf I were independent, I wouldn't have been so long without it.\nI would be older.\nDo you think people are forced to live in your grandfather's house?\nAn extremely conservative person.\nDo you think your grandfather is forced to live in a house with a person who smokes marijuana?\nDo you think your nephew is forced to feel the smell of marijuana?\nBut it was your father's choice that I would stay at home smoking marijuana\nthan take it to the street to avoid problems.\nTo avoid a smoker, something, understand?\nThat was my father's choice.\nIt was his choice.\nUntil he was able to face you and say that he didn't give you money.\nThat...\nWhy were you diagnosed?\nYes.\nAnd my mother simply decided...\nYou tried to treat yourself.\nYou fought, because you weren't going to take the medicine.\nThe medicine would leave you this and that.\nAnd my mother fought with Pedro.\nShe fought with Aline.\nShe got into a lot of trouble.\nIt was my mother's choice to hide.\nBecause at the time it was a shame to say that...\nThere is a difficulty.\nYes, but...\nLook, what a difficulty so many people...\nI know, but Aline...\nSo many successful people...\nI know, Aline.\nThe owner of EJZ, Rogerinho...\nHe was an extremely bright guy.\nI had a difficulty.\nYou threw the cover...\nI know, I know, Aline.\nBut I want you to understand...\nNow you're filling my bag.\nNo, I'm filling your bag.\nI'm here because the lawyer spoke to me.\nHe said, Sidney...\nYou can count on your sister's collaboration...\nTo be able to kill this thing.\nAnd then...\nThe lawyer who went there to put...\nPut an action saying that I'm...\nThat I'm doing homophobia.\nThis lawyer went there.\nWho went to do the homophobia action...\nI went to the police station.\nI'm guided by him.\nNo, I didn't.\nI went alone.\nI went alone.\nTell him that I'm going to get his name.\nNo, no, it wasn't.\nIt wasn't the lawyer.\nIt was the lawyer.\nIt was Caroline Rangel.\nAnd she didn't know.\nAnd the day she knew that I was going to the police station...\nShe said, Sidney, you're crazy.\nYou shouldn't have gone to the police station alone.\nI went alone to the police station.\nI was out of the house.\nI didn't know what to do.\nAnd I went to the police station.\nBut you didn't go to the police station, Sidney.\nI know.\nAnd you kept running away.\nAnd the guidance someone gave you...\nIt's all shit.\nI know.\nIf someone gave you guidance, you should have taken public defense.\nBecause you're thinking, do you think I'm in the state?\nBecause I know people.\nSidney, I only know people.\nPeople respect me.\nI understand.\nI work because I do social work.\nBecause I commit myself.\nYes.\nAnd, dear, I don't have any scheme.\nI don't have a vote purchase.\nI don't have any scheme.\nI know. Look.\nIt's just work.\nI have a commitment.\nYou didn't commit yourself to anything.\nYou kept speculating.\nBecause I know that everyone, Marcelo...\nEveryone wants to help you.\nThey also came to talk to me.\nThey said, Aline...\nEveryone wants to help you.\nBut you don't want to help yourself.\nSo I got to this point.\nDo you think you bring a flower to me?\nDo you think you bring a flower to me?\nDo you understand?\nAnd on the eve of the deal,\nwhen you're afraid of being arrested,\neverything will die.\nThen your lawyer came.\nHe told me.\nI don't know who he is on the day of the hearing.\nDo you understand?\nAnd I'll say...\nLook, you should have guided your client\nto do what was requested by him,\nwhat was requested by me,\nwhich is a very simple thing.\nNow, Sidney,\nall this will be resolved there.\nIf you want to receive your money,\ndo you understand?\nReceive your apartment,\nyour home.\nDo you understand?\nAnd do you want to change your life?\nI want to change my life.\nI'll tell you something.\nIt will be given to you\nthe day the money runs out.\nBut it will be written\nby the lawyer you will sign.\nIt will be scanned, it will be borrowed.\nThe day the money runs out,\ndon't tell us.\nAnd if Ricardo agrees,\ndon't tell us, don't tell me.\nI already have a single child.\nI know.\nLook, let me try to get to where I need to be.\nThe lawyer said that this thing\nabout money running out is serious,\nthat this can lead to a prison,\nwhich is not an integral prison,\nbut it can be a privation of liberty,\nwhich is a semi-open...\nHave you ever spoken to him\nabout the possibility of a treatment\nfor a person who has a problem?\nHasn't your lawyer noticed\nthat you have a problem?\nHe doesn't.\nFrom the experience he has,\nfrom the experience he has,\nhe only wants to deal with the crime of money running out.\nOnly the law.\nAnd the law is punitive.\nSo you go...\nIf you have a lawyer,\nhe should be concerned about making a defense\nand not saying that I'm cursing you.\nNo, but he wants to make a defense.\nIf he needs to know about you,\nif you are willing to collaborate...\nI am willing to collaborate\nand I will put my rules to collaborate\nif you don't follow the rules.\nI know, but when you get there,\nwhen you start to raise questions\nabout what has already happened,\nthis will generate a judgment.\nAnd from what I understand,\nthe collaboration should be...\nYou get there and say,\nno, there was a mistake,\nI made a mistake, he made a mistake,\nand that's it.\nReally?\nThat's it.\nReally, I made a mistake, he made a mistake,\nhe made a mistake, and that's it.\nDon't do that, Aline.\nI'm asking you.\nI'm asking you, don't do that.\nYou don't know what's behind it.\nI know, I know.\nYou don't know.\nI know, I know.\nI know everything.\nI work in the state.\nI know, Aline, but you don't know what's behind it.\nThe condemnation that came out there,\nif it's not the one of freedom,\nthe one of absorption,\nwill give Claudia and company\nthe weapon they need to criticize me.\nWhat I want to say to you\nin relation to money, to work, everything,\nis that there is a possibility\nof having work\nif Claudia agrees.\nIf Claudia agrees, there will be work.\nThere will be work.\nClaudia won't let us work.\nShe won't let us work.\nShe won't let us work.\nShe won't let us work,\nbut it turns out that there is an umbrella in the middle,\nand that umbrella can be used as an opportunity\nfor me to be able to work,\neven if it's against her,\nbecause she has plans,\nand I'm not part of her plans,\nand she wants to keep me away.\nSo, I even agree\nthat I may not want to participate\nin her plans anymore,\nand to leave the house\nand live somewhere else,\nI'm telling you that Uber is not bad,\nthere is no gas, but even without gas,\nI can make money,\nI'm making money,\nI just need to equalize the bills,\nbecause the money I received,\nI had to pay the debt.\nSo, introduce me.\nBut Aline, I'll introduce you,\nI would be learning things for you,\nso that you can,\nif you don't want to collaborate,\nbecause the first lawyer in the inventory said,\nif not even your brother trusts Aline,\nwhy would you trust him?\nMy brother doesn't trust anyone.\nMy brother doesn't trust anyone.\nHe didn't trust anyone,\nand he sent us out of his house several times,\nand he chose me.\nHe chose me too.\nHe chose everyone.\nHe chose me too.\nHe chose me too.\nHe chose everyone.\nAnd his allegation is that you and I\nlived our whole lives with money from Dad,\nand now he wants to get the bills right.\nIt's as if he wanted to keep everything.\nThat's it.\nIt's as if he wanted to keep everything.\nThat's why I'm not going to do...\nThat's why I'm not going to do...\nA deal with Ricardo.\nA deal with Ricardo.\nDo you know what Ricardo is going to do?\nWhen he signs...\nWhen he signs a consensual inventory,\nwhat is he going to do?\nHe's going to wait for your money to run out,\nand say,\nI don't want to sell for this price.\nBut he came here and changed the apartment key.\nHe changed the apartment key.\nBut Ricardo has a problem.\nThat's it.\nHe has a problem.\nIt's over.\nI've tried to call him,\nand in the last few days,\nevery day I try,\nand he doesn't answer.\nHe's really very angry with me.\nBut he lives...\nBecause he made a threat in his house.\nHe said,\nThere's no more soft money.\nThere's no more soft money.\nAnd he was surprised when this VGBL...\nHe didn't know that VGBL worked the way it worked.\nAnd I was full of money to pay,\nand I asked for help from him.\nHe didn't help.\nI asked for help from Letícia's father.\nI said,\nMr. Luiz, Mr. Felipe,\nhelp me, for God's sake,\nand my car bills are depending.\nAnd Mr. Felipe told me he didn't have any.\nI asked Letícia,\nI said,\nLetícia, please,\nthe car bills,\nthe car loan.\nThis month I've already paid the car loan.\nI've already paid the car insurance.\nAnd I have a reserve of at least 20,000\noutside of what's being invested.\nOkay, Cid and Ney, let's go.\nI have all the judges in the world with the money that's there.\nI'm not distributing the money\nlike I was disillusioned when I got my mother's money.\nI was disillusioned, then I rented a car,\nand then I went after companies,\nbecause I really have a problem\nthat is not just a psychological problem,\nof using drugs,\nof being temperamentally difficult,\nbut I have a sexual problem.\nI have a sexual problem.\nExactly.\nI have a sexual problem.\nThis girl who was here with me,\nshe is my friend,\nshe is over a year and a half old,\nand she also, sometimes,\nshe resents being with me\nand not being able to have a relationship with me.\nShe resents it, she gets resentful,\nshe gets sad,\nbut she understands me,\nshe tries to help me,\nshe talks to me,\nand I talk to her,\nshe also has her problems, you know?\nSo it was a friendship that I made\nand that I tried to have relationships,\nand I didn't,\nand they became friends.\nThey talk to me,\ntry to calm me down,\nand that's what I have at this moment,\nthat I can't,\nI still can't talk about this sexual problem\nwith the psychologist.\nI still can't talk about this sexual problem.\nIt didn't get to the point.\nStaying single and having sex, dear.\nLook, I've been single for six months,\na year,\nbecause I'm not,\nI'm only going to have sex when I love someone,\nwhen I get a boyfriend,\nwhen I get a nice person, you know?\nApart from that, I'd rather be single.\nIt's not possible that you can't do it.\nI'm trying.\nI'm trying.\nNakamura can do it.\nI'm trying, but...\nYou know, it's emotional balance.\nNakamura can do it.\nHe can, his wife...\nHe can't do it.\nBut Nakamura can do it.\nI've seen Nakamura at the door of...\nHow do you say it?\nThat gate in Jardim Botânico, Solário.\nI've seen Nakamura there.\nHe said, man, I'm going to do a little exercise there.\nI said, yeah, it's cool, man, it's cool.\nHe goes there, you know?\nTo look for girls.\nAnd he pays the price of the expensive girls.\nI don't do it anymore.\nI won't do it anymore.\nI won't do it anymore.\nI won't do it anymore.\nEven because it's a disappointment.\nBecause I get there and the disappointment is for me and for her.\nIt gets boring.\nThen I have to sit down, talk, say, man, I'm sorry.\nIt wasn't what I wanted, you know?\nAnd then it's a thing...\nThere's no disappointment for her.\nIt's a frustrating thing.\nEven though she's a prostitute.\nShe just wants to get her money.\nShe's not like that.\nBut I'm even more worried.\nDo you think she wants to have fun with you?\nShe doesn't want to.\nIt's not like you or Nakamura.\nMaybe...\nAnyway.\nShe dreams with Richard Gere.\nOr Naprile Oman.\nSomeone get her on the Gordeio Drive.\nMan, man.\nAnyway, I have...\nAt the end of the day, I...\nI end up sitting down, talking, apologizing.\nAnd...\nThat's it.\nToday I restricted my friendship\nwith these girls.\nWith these three girls.\nWhich are Anne.\nCarolina.\nAnd Danielle.\nWho you met at Dad's gallery.\nDanielle...\nDanielle isn't even a woman.\nShe's a transvestite.\nSo...\nThe lawyer who is dealing with this\nis an experienced lawyer.\nHe works with transvestites.\nIt was a transvestite who told me about him.\nGot it?\nSo he asked me.\nHe said, go there, talk to your sister.\nTell her that this thing in Maria da Penha\nis a complicated thing.\nAnd...\nI...\nI'm asking you.\nTo...\nThe answer he wants from me.\nHe said, ask your sister.\nIf she's willing to help you.\nI'm willing to help.\nOn the fifth day.\nOn the fifth day I'll put there\nall the rules.\nI know, Aline, but...\nWill this work?\nWhen you put...\nIt's over, Sidney. It's over.\nI won't stay...\nI know, but will this work?\nYou...\nYou wouldn't talk to him\nto know his looks?\nI'll talk...\nI'll talk to my lawyer\nto know if I can do this.\nGot it.\nIt's no use. He came...\nHe gave me the way to go there.\nI'm full of things.\nThen he keeps calling me.\nGot it?\nFrom the police station so I can go there.\nWith things.\nHe insulted me.\nHave you ever thought\nhow you fucked your mother's head?\nAnd your father's?\nHave you ever thought\nhow your mother raped you?\nWhen you put that girl...\nThat girl who committed suicide.\nWho was run over.\nShe disappeared.\nShe died.\nCaco, look.\nFor us.\nTo be loved.\nFirst we have to love each other.\nOkay.\nAnd you're empty.\nYou're crazy. You don't love each other.\nSo...\nYou're not going to be loved.\nI know.\nIf you think you deserve to go to jail,\ntell me you don't.\nBut this on condition...\nThis doesn't resolve in court.\nThis doesn't resolve in court.\nGod.\nThis doesn't resolve in court.\nLeo, don't talk\nabout this with your lawyer\nbecause you're only going to hear\nbad things about her.\nTalk to me.\nHe asked me\nif your sister would be willing to help you.\nIf you're willing\nto help me,\nhe knows\nthe way to solve this\nby getting a solution.\nNo.\nI'm willing to help.\nI know, but...\nSidney, don't go.\nIt's over.\nI'm talking to you.\nBefore I didn't even want to see your face.\nI wanted you to be arrested\nso you could fuck yourself.\nDo you think you didn't fuck yourself?\nYou fucked yourself.\nDo you know why I went to date Batista?\nBecause you beat everyone.\nPeople you loved,\nyou worshiped,\nand you started to respect me.\nNo, date Batista.\nYou think you need\npowerful people\nto be able to do something you don't need.\nYou think you need Favela\nto be able to do a project.\nYou're here wanting to fight against Claudia.\nClaudia is valuing the street.\nTo value the buildings.\nShe wants to build a closed condo.\nSo she brings the papers\nand says,\nClaudia, do you want to get Favela out of here?\nI'll leave too.\nNow,\nvalue my time.\nMy time is to make money to pay my son's bills.\nBecause the son of a bitch is enough for Andrea.\nNow, what happened in my life\nwas the following.\nI had to reach a limit\nto be able to say,\nit's over.\nAnd the limit was the following.\nIt was your father who solved it.\nIt was your father.\nEither he\nwill be treated\nand will be inserted in the family\nand we will do everything for him,\nor he can follow\nhis own life.\nOr he can follow his own life,\nI don't want to know anymore.\nSo, did you get treated?\nDid you run away from one, run away from another?\nI'm being treated.\nI have a psychiatrist.\nI have a psychologist.\nI'm being treated.\nI'm being treated.\nYou didn't go for the exam, Sidney.\nYou have a neurological psychological problem.\nWhere is the result of the exam?\nThe psychological exam\nwas initiated\nand after\nI was\ndoing the procedure,\nthe doctor changed.\nAnd the doctor who showed up,\nI didn't\nfeel like being with her.\nAnd then\nwhat happens is\nI need to find another\nspace\nto do the neuro-psychological exam.\nI'm\nbusy there,\nbut I have arrived very late\nat home.\nYesterday I left at 9 o'clock\nand I got home at 7 o'clock\nin the morning.\nI still had time to go to the market,\nto buy coconut water,\norange juice,\nso I wouldn't leave my son without a coffee,\nwithout anything,\nbecause there was no milk there,\nthere was no butter,\nthere was no butter.\nThere is butter, yes.\nThere may not be much, but there was\nthe rest of the butter left at the bakery.\nAnd there was milk.\nAnd look, it's time, my son is\n16 years old,\nI go there every day, I cook\nfor him, every day\nI go home, I don't know what this\nboy does. I spend the whole day\nin the video game. It's over\nfor him. It's over\nfor him. If he doesn't fit in,\nhe's going to get depressed\nand he's going to show\nthat he's having a hard time\nand he's going to treat\nhim. Or so, because the problem\neveryone has. I believe\nthe problem everyone has.\nI have, you have,\nI have.\nHow are we going to deal with the problem\nis what is important.\nSo, Sidney, look,\nI have no intention\nto put you\nin jail. So let's\nunderstand that... I'm not going to talk\nto the lawyer before the hearing.\nI'm not going to talk to the lawyer before the hearing.\nI'm going to do\nhere, I'm going to do\nwhat I\nwant,\nwhat I need you to\ncommit yourself to,\nso we can\ncontinue the hearing.\nThis will be talked about.\nI know, but look.\nThis lawyer of yours,\nshe's not the best person\nto advise you.\nThe day I was\narrested, she sent a message\nthat was not answered.\nSidney, I'm here\nto talk to you. The terms\nof what you can do,\nas if I, as if\nshe could\ndictate what I should\nor shouldn't do.\nI chose not to answer her\nand even\nwith all the difficulties,\nwithout the money, without\nanything, I went, I went\nto the fight to see what happened.\nSidney, I don't have a lawyer.\nI don't have a lawyer.\nI had a lawyer\nfrom Professor João Pedro\nand he was helping me. My lawyer\nis public defender.\nSo, let's go.\nWhat about the car\nloan, whatever,\neverything else?\nI'm going to pay.\nI'm going to talk to the lawyer.\nNo, but it was clear.\nI don't need it anymore.\nI don't need it anymore.\nThat was everything.\nThat was the arguments\nI used to get\nthe GBL out of the bank\nfaster.\nThe GBL, they are forced\nto release immediately.\nSo, it was\none of the arguments I had\ncoming there and talking\nto be able to see\nwhat was going on.\nYes, Sidney, but look.\nBecause it takes time.\nIt's an electronic process.\nBecause Ricardo\ndragged his\nprocess to mine.\nAnd the emails\nthat\ndemand,\ndemand documents\nthat go to Ricardo, came to me.\nIt's been more than a month\nthese emails coming.\nThey asked for more documents\nto Ricardo, more documents to Ricardo.\nThey asked for a lot of documents\nfor me too.\nI think they didn't release Ricardo.\nI think they didn't release Ricardo.\nMaybe, maybe now\nat this moment.\nMaybe now at this moment\nthey released him. Do you know why?\nBecause\nthe thing there\nworks automatically.\nSo, sometimes the money\nis released and continues\nto arrive, email.\nAnd then the orientation\nof the person in the inventory\nof the bank was\ndon't answer, Sidney.\nWhat has already been resolved is already resolved.\nSo, exactly.\nBut look, I'm not here\nto\nfuck with anyone.\nI'm not here to be able to\nRicardo came to open the apartment thinking\nI want to leave.\nI'm not even going to stay in Rio de Janeiro.\nGot it?\nNow, what did Ricardo do\nto send the\njob to block the account?\nBut everything my father did\nand talked about, he said\nRicardo, got it?\nSo, everything\nmy father did, we almost thought.\nWhen he was still\nbetter off.\nGot it?\nSo, Ricardo, you\nentered\nthe account without authorization\nand so on and so on. He called the manager\nand the manager said, no, no, no.\nMy father came here\nand signed\nand was interrogated\nand answered. I was with\nso, so\nin full\ncapacity\nto answer\nand make the decision.\nSo, I'm not here.\nSidney, money\nin my life is not\nthe most important thing. Ricardo has a very\nbad relationship with money.\nI'm not going to discuss that.\nGot it? I'm not going to discuss it.\nNow, I don't want to be stuck\nin an inventory\nwith Ricardo and you. Got it?\nAnd now Ricardo is trying to\nstop you just to\nfight.\nGot it? He's trying to stop you just\nto fight. Got it?\nAnd say that he has\npower, because he thinks I want to\nstop you. Got it?\nSo, I want to know, first\nwho took the folder.\nGot it? I'm going there\nin Maria da Penha, I'm going to do a\nB.O.A. Got it?\nSo, I'm here\nto be able to solve things with love.\nWith love.\nLove.\nBut don't ask me, Sidney.\nDon't ask me, you know why?\nBecause it involves a lot of things.\nIncluding Ricardo mixing me up.\nI don't know what you're going to want to know,\nman.\nI'm going to put a limit on the person.\nDo you think the person is going to mistreat me?\nIt's over. I don't want...\nIt's over. I'm going to go up, I'm going to pay\nJoão Pedro's school. It's over.\nI went to heaven, I asked for a discount.\nGive me a discount, please.\nMy father said, if I'm unemployed,\nbecause I was taking care of my father,\nthey gave me a 50% discount.\nSo, I talked to João Pedro.\nRicardo is not going to pay school\nto say, I'm good,\nI'm taking João Pedro.\nBecause he's shitting.\nHe doesn't like anyone. He doesn't even like his wife\nor his son.\nHe doesn't lick Leticia the way he licks.\nHe doesn't drink the way he drinks.\nHe doesn't cause any confusion in the street.\nSo, Ricardo has a problem.\nHe has a problem.\nHe has a problem with the psychiatrist.\nI call everyone to report.\nRicardo sucks.\nEverything Ricardo does wrong,\nI have here.\nDoes he think he's going to fuck me up?\nI'm going to drink Coca-Cola.\nI'm not here to fuck anyone up.\nBut, you know,\nwhen the bucket is filling up,\nand then comes the limit.\nBut in the moment\nthat you\nwalk in this way,\nthis will generate a condemnation.\nDo you think you're going to the audience?\nNo, you're going to the audience.\nOf course you have to go to the audience.\nYou have to go.\nYou have to go.\nAnd Ricardo, go there.\nI want to quote you.\nSo, you have to go.\nI have to go. He has to go.\nBecause he has a testimony.\nThe three of us have to go.\nBut what I wanted\nis that you\nunderstand that\nthis can generate\na punishment.\nAnd this punishment can be\npunishment of restriction of freedom.\nThere is no alternative punishment\nYou've thought about it.\nYou've thought about it.\nYou're crazy about it.\nI'm not, Aline.\nThis is how it works.\nI'm not reading electronics.\nI'm not reading electronics.\nLet me tell you something.\nI'm not reading electronics.\nI have a headache.\nI'm full of pain in my body.\nI've been discussing it for an hour.\nYou came in here.\nI came in, I closed the key.\nYou came in.\nYou didn't ring the bell.\nI did ring the bell.\nI did ring the bell.\nYou came in.\nI did ring the bell.\nI don't want to discuss it with you.\nI'm not here to...\nI've already said it.\nNow, thank God,\nmy father died that day.\nThank God,\nmy father died.\nI'm calmer.\nNow,\nyou have to do the treatment.\nIt's over.\nI'm doing the treatment, Aline.\nYou didn't do the tests, Sidney.\nYou didn't do anything.\nYou're doing the treatment\nin a place that I didn't know.\nI don't know how you're going to the treatment.\nIn the other car.\nIt's over.\nSo, Sidney, take a load\nfrom your therapist.\nYou'll have to do an evaluation.\nThe evaluation will have to be\nby the municipality.\nThe state doesn't work in the municipality, dear.\nIt's going to be by the municipality.\nYou gave it your all.\nThe family clinic, everyone wanting to help you.\nNow, Aline, I was wrong.\nMan, you were wrong.\nWhat kind of evaluation\ndo you think\nthis will give?\nWill it give an interdiction to me?\nNo.\nLook, Ricardo only\nbelieves if I sign it.\nIf you tell me, Aline,\nI don't want\nyou to try to get any money.\nBut\nI'm going to sign a term here\nsaying that if my money runs out\nI'm not going to look for you.\nI'm going to become a beggar.\nOf course.\nOtherwise you'll disturb everyone.\nNo, Aline, no.\nYou'll disturb everyone.\nNo, Aline, no.\nI don't have the money I used to have.\nSo\nI earn\nI work, I earn.\nAnd I think I earn little.\nAnd I have the intention to earn more.\nBut for my intention\nthen you say\nthe project\nyou're going to get involved with Claudia's business.\nYes.\nBut Claudia is making money.\nAlexandre\nAlexandre\nAlexandre\nis listed in the Rato's\nThe name of his\nis Marujo.\nSo it's not good, Sidney.\nHe is corrupt.\nEveryone is, Sidney.\nWhat he\ncan be doing behind\nof a judge\nof a promoter\nyou don't know.\nYour brother is too.\nEveryone is.\nI'm not. I'm sure.\nI have difficulty paying my bills\nbut I never accepted.\nI never accepted.\nMoney, scheme.\nIt may be that Ricardo\nis in agreement with Gordo.\nIt may be that he has made a deal\nwith Gordo.\nHe's getting in the wrong with everyone.\nHe's getting in the wrong with Gordo.\nGordo wants to sell.

I'll tell you what happened.\nHe gave me an entrance.\nHe asked for my intervention?\nHe gave me an entrance back there.\nAnd then what happened?\nHe stopped the process.\nBecause he's vulgar.\nBecause he doesn't understand anything about family.\nHe's too powerful.\nHe gave me an entrance.\nLook, Sidney.\nIf I don't sign, he doesn't forbid you.\nI know.\nBut he has a new process.\nLet me tell you.\nHe gave me an entrance.\nAnd then what did he do?\nHe stopped the process.\nBecause if he asked for your intervention\nhe would have to answer.\nDo you understand?\nNo.\nIf he asked for your intervention\nhe would have to pay all the costs.\nYes.\nHe would have to support you for the rest of your life.\nYes.\nBut what does he want?\nWhat did we talk about?\nIt's like this.\nRicardo wanted you\nto put yourself\nin Recreio's apartment\nand give me a table for you.\nAnd then I said, man,\nno, no, for me I want Sidney to deal with it.\nThe way it is,\nhe's at 200,\n220, 440,\nhe's going to hit his head on the post,\nhe's going to die, you know?\nHe could even think it's good for him to die.\nAnyway, because\nminus one to divide mine.\nBut Sidney, in the end,\nyou're my brother.\nObviously I love you.\nThere's no way you can't love your family.\nNow you're just\nrespecting me.\nNow you painted and embroidered.\nAnd in fact it wasn't now, it wasn't the whole life.\nBecause I take the history here\nof you mumbling.\nYou called me at dawn mumbling.\nYou called me a failure.\nThe whole life.\nSo you needed to get to that point.\nAnd look, God is too great.\nBecause my father needed\nnot to be able to\nmanage his life anymore.\nHe needed my father to be fragile\nto be able to say\nI don't want it anymore.\nI can't take it anymore.\nMy father said, I can't take it anymore.\nHow many times did you come in and out of the house?\nHow many times did you come in and\nknock on the door?\nDid you call\nSão Paulo to support the room?\nDid you always\ncomfort everyone?\nWait, Sidney.\nCalm down.\nI'm talking.\nNo, Sidney.\nYou have to understand that\nthis caused\na mess.\nThe whole world.\nIncluding João Pedro.\nDo you know what happened to my parents?\nIt's from the França Miranda family.\nDon't solve\nthings.\nIt's from the França Miranda family.\nDon't solve things.\nNow you're talking\nto me and this is normal.\nAnd now you're talking to me.\nYou're another person, Sidney.\nYou enter in silence\ninside the house.\nYou give a discharge.\nYou didn't give a discharge.\nYou give a discharge\nand you leave the bathroom clean.\nYou wash the dishes.\nIt got to the point where you\nbroke the glass, called Tatiana\nand said, get this.\nTatiana,\nthe person gets\nat least one hour.\nWakes up at four in the morning.\nYou don't have\n...\nYour speech is beautiful, but\n...\nIt's not speech.\nYou don't have respect for the next person.\nI know, Sidney, but\nit's not speech.\nI just want you\nnot to adjust\nClaudia to do her plans.\nFrom the moment\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nBecause he, suddenly, in that situation, he didn't say it to you, but he said it to me,\nhe thought he was going to go out there, something that would distract him from his routine.\nI didn't think so, you know why? Because I talked to him and said,\nDad, do you want the car to come back?\nI mean, I'm going out, there's no problem.\nI said, no, daughter, I want you.\nThe joy of the house, look, after ten o'clock I went to the fridge,\nI brought the fridge from the producer, you know what, daughter?\nAfter ten o'clock, it's amazing.\nYou have no idea what it was.\nYou have no idea how many internazions,\nyou have no idea how many prostitutes I went with dad.\nYou have no idea, you know why?\nYou were going there and you only disturbed the internazion of you.\nDad, it's me, it's me.\nYou never went there, Dad, today I have to give you love.\nDo you understand, Sidney?\nYou need to look and build values that were not built by you.\nEverything is fine there, just think.\nReally, this is the most important thing.\nIt's weighing, and what I have to tell you is,\nthis will give more space for Manga,\nwith something that is an objective,\nan urban objective, an objective of the city,\na vision of the city, where it was planned,\ninside the Miga Pereira, where Cláudia sat,\nAlexandre Reis, the little bear, the son of the judge,\nand another half of the people, they made a plan there,\nand it was the fight with this plan.\nAnd in their plan, they had to choose the enemy.\nWho is the enemy?\nYou're kidding, man, this is a way of persecution.\nNo, it's not.\nMy brother looks, apologizes, this is a way of persecution.\nDidn't you say he had a dossier against me?\nHe has a dossier against you,\nof all the viruses you got in the street.\nAnd there are great things, they can have a dossier,\nwhat they want.\nWere they a delegation from the board?\nThe complaint they gave, did the process work?\nIt didn't work.\nSo much so that I was arrested,\nand the custody agency released me,\nbecause you're going to pull the historical record,\ndoes your brother have a problem with justice?\nNo, so he's not a person who has to be arrested.\nOh, that's dangerous.\nYeah, he doesn't have to be arrested.\nLet me tell you something, did you respond to the process?\nNo, because...\nI don't know what you're talking about.\nThere's nothing you can say, I'm going to ask Claudia...\nActually, I'm not going to ask Claudia anything.\nI'm going to put her in her place.\nNo, I didn't respond to the process.\nShe's going to send a petition.\nI didn't respond to the process,\nI didn't respond to the process,\nbecause everything that was taken to the police,\nthe first time it was a threat,\nbecause I insisted,\nI went after them to try to negotiate,\nand I wanted, I wanted, I wanted,\nand they kicked me out, out, out,\none day I went up to Christmas,\nand I was desperate,\nbecause my dad, all his life,\nwas pressing me, you have to work, you have to work, you have to work,\nand I saw an exit in that favela situation,\nand I was pressing them, pressing them,\nand they ignored me as if I were an idiot,\nand one day I went up drunk on Christmas,\nand I went to her door and cursed.\nShe got the delegate,\nwhich is not a normal thing,\nbut she got the delegate to make a complaint.\nThere was an audience of conciliation,\nthat was with Gekrinho,\nand I got there,\nlook, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\nand the process died, the archival process.\nBut she made a complaint,\nbecause you already have the precedent\nof not disturbing...\nNo, but I know, but I understand,\nbut every complaint she makes,\nhas to generate a process,\nand that has to take place, and the end...\nShe didn't take place, because...\nShe didn't take place, because in fact,\nnobody wants to fuck you, Carlos.\nI know, but...\nI just want that...\nSo what?\nSo what?\nSo what?\nLook, after you have fixed all this mess,\ndo you think they will open up space?\nI learned something in the state, Cid.\nI had everything to attack.\nThere is a person,\nwho was fired along with me,\nwho keeps threatening,\nshe went back to the state.\nShe knows things,\nshe keeps threatening.\nI never said anything,\nI collected myself,\nI'm in mine,\nI didn't post anything,\nI didn't say anything,\nnow they are calling me back.\nI'm not going, because they exonerated me.\nI'm going back to the state,\nto another place,\nto the place where I will deliver the projects\nthat I have to be able to deliver.\nNow, stay quiet from yours.\nIn a little while I will be in the state,\ndoing the lighting project.\nI'm tired of helping you, Cid.\nI'm tired of helping you.\nI'm tired of helping you.\nThen you go there,\nyou were doing the project,\nthen you leave the project,\nthen you got into the hospital,\nyou were run over,\nthen it became a mess.\nSo, you get in the way,\nyou are much smarter than me and Ricardo together.\nI was, I was.\nBut you don't have emotional intelligence,\nCid.\nI'm going to talk about you,\nyou were really helped by you.\nRicardo also tried to help me,\nwith his humility,\nhe said, Cid, come here,\nget me a computer,\nhe paid me very little,\nhe paid me very little,\nbut he gave me an occupation.\nI didn't have the measure\nof what you were doing with me,\nof what you were doing with me,\nmaybe I could have given more than me,\nbut this has a lot of my,\nof my shyness,\nthings that I lost\nnow working with Uber.\nI now,\nI now had to face\na job\nwith Uber,\nwhere I missed several times,\nUber caught my attention\nseveral times,\nCid, you talk too much.\nIt's in school, of course it's in school,\nand when it's like this,\nyou can't talk to me,\nyou keep calling, you don't know\nthat I don't have internet on this phone,\nwhen I don't have internet,\nthe message doesn't come in,\nyou're tired of knowing that, my son,\nso you keep calling, you know,\nI sent a lot of messages\nyou didn't receive,\ngo to school and keep calling,\nyou have a phone for that.\nUber sent a lot of messages,\nand I was correcting\nwith time,\nI was correcting,\nso today I know how to\ntreat the client,\nI know my place,\nto position myself,\nI had never worked\nlike this,\nwhere I needed,\nreally needed\nto keep the job,\nand then,\nwith this need,\nI was broken by Uber,\nUber is\na platform\nthat warns\nbefore taking an attitude,\nto block these things,\nand it was changing me,\ntoday I'm an Uber driver,\nalmost platinum level,\nwhere I can choose\nthe area I work,\nwhere I can\nput the car in the break,\nand even\nwhen I'm using Bermuda,\nI still get,\nlast week\nI got R$53\nof cash,\nit's a lot of cash,\na lot of cash that can be given,\nit's simple,\ncongratulations,\ncongratulations, I'm happy\nto hear that,\nI'm happy to hear that,\nI just want you to take it into consideration,\nI will take it into consideration,\nI'm not here to fuck you,\nI'm not here to put anyone\nin jail,\nbut you have to be careful with justice,\nI don't have to be careful with justice,\nI know how to manage\nthings,\nso that\nyou have\nthe result you need,\nyes, but the result I need\nI'm already doing,\nyou've improved a lot,\ntreatment,\nbut let me\ntalk, man,\nI'm in pain, I'm all fucked up,\nI can't stay here,\nthe whole house, the bathroom,\nis full of things,\nof your stupidity,\nyou know,\nGod,\nit's a pig,\nit's a pig,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nshe's a beast,\nshe's a beast,\nyou're going to get a spurt,\nAline is mine,\nshe's a woman of my life,\nshe's mine,\nI know, Aline,\nshe's not a bitch,\nshe's my friend,\nshe's my friend,\nshe's just a woman,\na woman,\nI don't know if it was a mistake, but it was because I didn't fix the mistake.\nIf I had fixed the mistake, she would have corrected it.\nI'm counting on you, to be able to solve this on the day of the hearing.\nSo that there is no reason for Claudia to be glorifying what she did.\nI'm counting on you, to be able to solve this on the day of the hearing.\nIt's not a mistake, it's a mistake.\nYou caused a lot of trouble, I had to leave home early, I lived in my friends' house.\nEveryone is very stupid.\nClaudia has a project.\nI know, but her project will harm half the world.\nIf her project will harm half the world, it will harm the world.\nShe managed to create an urban reform.\nThis urban reform can both benefit you and Claudia.\nThe urban reform...\nThe urban reform she wants is to transport VLT in front of Miguel Pereira.\nIt would make her life easier.\nIt would make her life easier.\nIt would ruin everyone's life for two or three years.\nIt would ruin everyone's life for two or three years.\nYes, but do you know...\nHave you sat down with Ricardo to know if he will want to wait three years to sell the property?\nNo.\nBecause until now, what is in that property is IPTU.\nIt's IPTU Gas and Light.\nAnd what about this plane?\nThat's true. I don't want to pay for it.\nI don't want to pay for it either.\nI don't want to pay for it either.\nI don't think this project will come out because there won't be any money.\nAnyway, the guy is messing around.\nExactly.\nThe guy is messing around.\nLook, here's the document.\nHere's her document asking...\nYou asked for the document, I stopped here to show you.\nShe asked for the street to be transformed into a closed street.\nHere.\nAsking for what?\nAsking for the residents.\nShe sent...\nYou know she...\nShe has to be unanimous.\nYes, she sent it to circulate to everyone.\nYes.\nSo she needs the votes of everyone.\nNow she doesn't need it anymore because there's a law where...\nIf...\nIf 60% agree, she can take action.\nSo much so that she...\nBut I can make a movement against it.\nYou can.\nYou can.\nThen I can say, look, Cláudia, I'm not in favor of it.\nExactly.\nBut she...\nBut she...\nI know.\nBut if you go against her, she'll want to turn into your enemy too.\nLook here.\nWait.\nHere's the document.\nI don't need Cláudia for anything.\nHere's the document.\nPlease read it for your safety.\nI don't know how I do it.\nI'll send it to you.\nSend it to João Pedro so he can send it to me.\nI'll send it to Cláudia and say,\nCláudia, I didn't receive this correspondence.\nNo, I'm not going to say anything now.\nI have a lot of problems to solve.\nYes, I think it's better if you...\nIf you want, I'll send all the documents.\nThe organic cycle.\nEverything.\nYes, I can go there too.\nI can cause a lot of...\nI can delay her life.\nYou can?\nI don't know, all the processes I'm in the States...\nSo, I can...\nI can do that.\nI can even say, look, I'm not in a hurry.\nBut...\nDo you want to close the street to be able to work with the condo?\nI want to see all the accounts.\nThe account has to be open.\nI want to see all the accounts.\nAll the expenses of the street to be able to know if I want to work with that.\nI'm not in a hurry.\nI'm going to say that I'm going to make a movement against it.\nI'm going to send you...\nI'm going to send everything to João Pedro.\nIt's over.\nAnd then you take care of everything.\nBut we have to have people...\nAnd I'm not even going to say that you're not in a hurry.\nYou're going to go to the bank.\nAnd then you're going to start arguing.\nYou're going to say, no, it's money.\nCome on.\nIt's going to be a mess.\nWhy do we laugh at that?\nNo.\nThere are a lot of people who don't have money to pay for the condo.\nNot even to pay.\nThat's right.\nI could pay.\nBut you made so much trouble that I almost paid.\nYou made so much trouble that I almost stopped paying.\nBut I thought it was good.\nWhat was the price of the condo there?\nIt was...\nIt was 150.\nBut it was increasing progressively.\nToday it must be about 500.\nI think it's very expensive.\nIt's the contribution to the housing association.\nApart from the fact that she passes the book...\nThe little book to be able to collect for that land there.\nI never even sat there.\nAnd apart from that she uses those guards\nas a common denominator for discussion.\nWhy?\nIt's in those guards that the discussion happens\nand where she can add people.\nWhy?\nBecause the guards want to receive.\nAnd there are people who don't want to pay.\nThat's right.\nSo we don't pay.\nThey want to receive.\nAnd then it becomes a passive worker.\nIt becomes a passive worker.\nBut passive this worker\nthat could have been resolved\nback when I talked to them.\nI said, guys, keeping this guy there is complicated.\nI went to the meeting, I put a letter,\nI said, it's complicated.\nThe guy is getting involved.\nNow she must know that.\nIf she becomes a condo, she forces everyone\nand she makes everyone work with a retroactive.\nExactly.\nShe wants to make everyone, all units, work with a retroactive.\nI'll say, look, I'm a resident.\nI've never collaborated with her.\nBut then it's part of her plan\nto put you out.\nSell the house.\nDo you know, do you know if in this inventory\nthat Ricardo is running,\nhe is requesting my interdiction?\nI haven't had access to this document yet.\nIt's ready.\nYeah, I know.\nMarcel Picuca gave me a lawyer.\nHe's asking me to do it.\nBut I agree with the request of you two.\nI don't want to put a lawyer in it.\nBecause he wants 15%.\nThe other one wanted 10%.\nThe other one wanted 10%.\nThen after he asked for 10%, he came with a story.\nOh, but now that you've received the money...\nMarcel Picuca is very complicated.\nHe's already had a conflict.\nHe's already had a conflict.\nHe's already had a conflict with the producer.\nHe's already had a conflict with the producer.\nHe's already had a conflict with the producer.\nHe's not a person who doesn't sign anything.\nAnd you say, sorry, I'm coming.\nBecause he's very complicated.\nYeah, he could be with the lawyer since the hole.\nI don't think so.\nI think he's going to be upset with you.\nMaybe not, right?\nMaybe not.\nYeah, maybe it's not the same as the 4,000.\nTake him away.\nI'm not going away.\nYou took the keys from the house.\nSo you don't say you didn't come in because you don't have the keys.\nHave you already given it to João Pedro?\nNo, but I can leave one here and take the other one to him.\nThat's it, take the keys to him.\nNow it's 40 reais.\nI'm going to pay.\nNo, you don't have to.\nI'm going to pay.\nNo, you don't.\nI'm going to pay.\nNo, you don't.\nOh, okay.\nI'm so tired.\nI'm tired of you.\nI don't like anyone.\nI don't like anyone.\nI'm talking to you.\nThe dialogue is usually...\nYou're going to tell me that you don't want to apologize.\nNo.\nYou're going to apologize that...\nNo, I'm putting you in reality. That's why you haven't understood yet.\nI'm not even there for Claudia, but the people behind her, who are the big constructors, are there for Claudia.\nShe will see if she can do it.\nShe can.\nDid you also lose the key to the door of this apartment?\nWhat?\nDid you lose the key to the door of this apartment?\nDude, I don't know where the key is.\nYeah.\nI don't know where the key is.\nYou have to lock the door of the apartment, because the door is open.\nThe door is open, yes.\nOkay.\nThe door is open.\nI'm not going to call anyone here.\nThe door is open.\nThe door is open.\nYeah.\nThe door is open.\n --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters"
